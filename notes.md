# Notes for Media Studies 200

These notes are intended for students in Media Studies 200. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or correct any of them, especially if you encounter a mistake or typo. Please also inform me if a key point from a given week isn't in the notes.

Consult the [glossary](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/glossary.html) for definitions of key terms in Media Studies. 

## Week 1 (Sept. 7): Media Are Material Agents 

Hello and welcome to Media Studies 200! I designed this course for us to engage four types of media: *audio, images, text, and video*. 

Allow me to define "media." They are *material agents* for *transforming* "this" into "that" by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means. Audio may turn sound into an MP3 file or vinyl record, for instance, and images may turn light or graphics into a photograph or JPG file.

This definition implies that media are subject to the elements. Vinyl records warp in extreme heat, and analog photographs fade in the sun. Digital media decay, degrade, and disappear, too. A [survey](https://zenodo.org/record/8161056) conducted recently by Phil Salvador concluded that "[o]nly 13 percent of classic video games published in the United States are currently in release" (2). If you want to play many of these "lost" games legally, then you'll likely need [access to vintage hardware](https://hcl.library.uvic.ca/). 

These physical aspects of media are the facts of media studies, and media scholars don't have much to study without access to the stuff of audio, images, text, and video. That's merely the start of it. Once we grasp media as materials, we must also learn to approach them critically and responsibly as forms of *mediation* in the world. Doing so enriches our understanding and experience of them. It also improves our chances of producing compelling content in the present moment.  

Surveying critical approaches to media and producing compelling content with them are the primary aims of Media Studies 200. What functions do media serve in interpersonal and mass communication? How are media also artistic or cultural practices? How do we make meaning and construct narratives with media, how are they owned or controlled, how do they address or act upon us, and what roles do they play in identity, power, oppression, memory, and everyday life? These questions and more will guide us through the term, and along the way they'll correspond with other popular frameworks for media, including: 

* "the media" (the means of mass communication, like broadcasting, publishing, and the internet), 
* "elemental media" (such as earth, water, air, and fire), and even
* how our bodies become media during communication. 

I do not want and will not expect you to adopt every angle on media studies that we'll try in this course. My hope is you'll identify one approach that resonates well with your interests and apply it to produce your own content for the final project (due by Friday, December 15th). Each week of Media Studies 200 has a theme and primary source(s) that should assist you in that application, and every approach will be "multimodal" in some fashion&#8212;that is, it will invite more than one mode of communication or sensation to combine activities such as hearing, listening, seeing, looking, watching, reading, touching, and playing.

**Questions for Week 1**

Why take a Media Studies course in 2023? What even is Media Studies? And how would you put "material agent" in your own words when describing media? One way to address this question is to focus on glitches, bugs, buffers, breakdowns, and whatnot&#8212;those palpable moments when we realize we're not in complete control of how this becomes that. When have you encountered such resistance in the materials, and what did you do? (Waiting is hard these days.)

**Technique for Week 1**

Denotation: identify and describe four types of media or "material agents" in *M00D*. 

**Approaches addressed in Week 1**

Multimodality, transduction, digital preservation 

**Recap of Week 1**

Denotation is a literal description of a work's physical characteristics and your experience of them (e.g., what you see, hear, smell, read, watch, touch).

* As a technique, it's particularly useful when a work invites you to leap into interpretations of its symbols, context, deeper meaning, and whatnot.
* It also helps you to underscore how a work was *made* (labour) or *composed* (craft) and the degree to which it's accessible as both an experience and a physical artifact.  

## Week 2 (Sept. 11 and 14): Media and Interpersonal Communication

This week, media are not only material agents but also in the *middle* of your communication with someone else. Interpersonal communication usually refers to forms of one-to-one, two-way communication, including spoken language, sign language, and body language&#8212;instances when you may very well be the *messenger*. As the name suggests, interpersonal communication stresses in-person or "face-to-face"  communication yet may also involve everyday communications from a distance, like texting and phone calls. We'll talk about the rhetorical situations of interpersonal communication and how they shape the ways we relate to other people. We'll also consider those moments when media enhance interpersonal communication and when we feel like we're shouting into the abyss.  

Critical approaches to media, including interpersonal approaches, are most compelling when they account for *intersectionality* (see, for instance, bell hooks, Brittney Cooper, and Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined ["intersectionality" in 1989](https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf)). Intersectionality "is the study of overlapping or intersecting social identities and related systems of oppression, domination, or discrimination. The theory suggests that—and seeks to examine how—various biological, social and cultural categories such as gender, race, class, ability, sexual orientation, religion, caste, age, nationality and other sectarian axes of identity interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels" ([Syracuse University Libraries 2023](https://researchguides.library.syr.edu/fys101)). Dr. Crenshaw further explains intersectionality in this [2018 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViDtnfQ9FHc).

**Questions for Week 2** 

What to you is an immediate experience? How do media bring personal differences into relation? When do you use media to connect with someone else, and when have media alienated you or rendered you vulnerable? 

**Primary source for Week 2**

**Approaches addressed in Week 2** 

Intersectionality, rhetoric, affordance theory, symbolic interactionism, looking-glass self, impressions management, dramaturgy, parallel play

**Recap of Week 2**

On the question of media's role in interpersonal communication 

* Interpersonal communication is historically associated with F2F or in-person communication (where you are likely the messenger), so . . . what happens when we add audio, image, text, and video to that dynamic?
* The practices of rhetoric, intersectionality, looking-glass self, impression management, and dramaturgy help us to address that question.

*Intersectionality*

* How am I positioned in this communication, and how am I experiencing it?  
* How is this communication addressing power inequities and systemic biases? How is it reproducing them? 
* What is the setting of the communication, who is at the centre, and how responsive are they to correction or change? 
* To what degree is the communication two-way, and how does it not only recognize personal differences but also bring them into relation?  
* Intersectionality underscores the fact any work of media will never have homogeneous or uniform effects (and thus interpretations will vary); we bring our lived experiences, including those of inequity and systemic bias, to the table of communication.  

*Looking-glass self*

* How does this person perceive me when we communicate?
* How do they judge that perception? 
* How am I developing a "real-time" sense of identity in light of that hypothetical judgement? (It's hypothetical because most aspects of  interpersonal communication are *left to the imagination*.
* Note: the looking-glass self tends to overlook not only systemic issues like discrimination but also differences between types of social and cultural groups, with far more attention to “fit” than nonconformity, but it’s still somewhat common in social media discourse.

*Impression management*

* How do I communicate a persistent identity in this space or situation? 
* How might that consistency become my "brand" or a story of who I am? 
* How do I help ensure that people will interpret my message as I intended it?
* Note: impression management is most useful when studying interpersonal and mass communication *strategies* for self-branding (or “defining your brand”) on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.

*Dramaturgy*

* What social role can or should I assume in this interpersonal communication? 
* How should that role be performed? What, for instance, will others expect me to communicate? What happens if I "break character"?
* Where is the "front stage" of the communication? That is, where will I perform socially? 
* Where is the "back stage" of the communication? That is, where will I prepare for the performance or "relax" from playing my role? 
* Note: the dramaturgy model is most useful when studying the roles or “characters” people play in the organizational communication of formal institutions like governments and schools. Also, the boundaries between front and back are often blurred; a course on Zoom, where our homes are integrated with the online classroom and you get to meet my cat, is an example of such blurred boundaries.

*Games and Interpersonal Communication*

During class, we recognized why activities like texting and phone calls involve interpersonal communication even if they do not occur face-to-face or in person. What if we pushed that inquiry further to consider video games? Can a video game be a conversation? Marina Kittaka's *Secrets Agent* will help us to address that question. 

## Week 3 (Sept. 18 and 21): Media and Mass Communication

This week, media are not only material agents but also *channels* for transmitting messages or *vehicles* for encoding and decoding them. Sender-receiver and one-to-many dynamics are common in the mass communication paradigm. Investments in information, fidelity, encryption, and scale are common, too. We'll talk about mass communication in the contexts of convergence and globalization and then revisit our Week 2 discussions about interpersonal communication. 

**Questions for Week 3** 

Do you think a message can be separated or extracted from its media or context? Is mass communication a linear process? When and why might you ask, "Can you hear me?" or "Did you get my message?" And when and why might you declare, "There will be no more communication"? 

**Primary source for Week 3** 

[Season 1, Cassette 1](https://beta.prx.org/stories/232303) of Janina Matthewson, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, and Nightvale's [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), which "takes the form of an audio course in full body relaxation issued by The Institute to you (the listener), a nameless medical inmate. Is the narrator relaying something more than just relaxation techniques? As listeners move through the relaxation curriculum a deeper and more personal story unravels." Content warning: bugs (including bug abuse), gaslighting, stalking, medical setting, and themes related to mental health and pathologization

**Format for Week 3** 

Podcast (anthology)

**Technique for Week 3** 

Recontextualization: develop the backstory for Oleta or Hester in *Within the Wires* to further explain why she performs the role of sender or receiver in the story's one-to-one and one-to-many communications. 

**Approaches addressed in Week 3**

the transmission model of communication, the social model of communication, two-step flow, convergence

## Week 4 (Sept. 25 and 28): Media and Communication as Culture

This week, media are not only material agents but also *practices* that reproduce the communication habits and values of a *community* or *worldview*. Think of cosplay or Reddit communities, for example, alongside phrases like "indie culture," "the culture of Hollywood," "queer culture," and "gamer culture." Culture is, in this sense, a way of living and the content or "canon" associated with it. We'll talk about media and power as well as how cultural approaches offer alternatives to "media effects" paradigms or transmission models of communication. 

**Questions for Week 4** 

Why are media so often associated with popular culture? Do you think people tend to passively, actively, or selectively engage media? How are media entwined with how we learn to look, watch, listen, play, and even construct a reality? How do media practices become habits or institutions? 

**Primary sources for Week 4** 

Momo Pixel's [*Hair Nah*](https://www.momopixel.com/hair-nah) (2017), "a travel game about a black woman who is tired of people touching her hair." Content warning: "micro-aggression of assumed authority and ownership of black bodies." 

Adrian Tomine's ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/killing-and-dying/) (2015), "a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images." Content warning: conflict between parents, bad dad, and themes of assimilation and leaving home.
