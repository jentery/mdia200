# Notes for Media Studies 200

These notes are intended for students in Media Studies 200. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or correct any of them, especially if you encounter a mistake or typo. Please also inform me if a key point from a given week isn't in the notes.

## Week 1 (Sept. 7): Media Are Material Agents 

Hello and welcome to Media Studies 200! I designed this course for us to engage four types of media: *audio, images, text, and video*. 

Allow me to define "media." They are *material agents* for *transforming* "this" into "that" by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means. Audio may turn sound into an MP3 file or vinyl record, for instance, and images may turn light or graphics into a photograph or JPG file.

This implies that media are subject to the elements. Vinyl records warp in extreme heat, and analog photographs fade in the sun. Digital media decay, degrade, and disappear, too. A [survey](https://zenodo.org/record/8161056) conducted recently by Phil Salvador concluded that "[o]nly 13 percent of classic video games published in the United States are currently in release" (2). If you want to play many of these "lost" games legally, then you'll likely need [access to vintage hardware](https://hcl.library.uvic.ca/). 

These physical aspects of media are the facts of media studies, and media scholars don't have much to study without access to the stuff of audio, images, text, and video. That's merely the start of it. Once we grasp media as materials, we must also learn to approach them critically and responsibly as forms of *mediation* in the world. Doing so enriches our understanding and experience of them. It also improves our chances of producing compelling content in the present moment.  

Surveying critical approaches to media and producing compelling content are the primary aims of Media Studies 200. What are the roles of media in interpersonal and mass communication? How are media also artistic or cultural practices? How do we make meaning and construct narratives with media, how are they owned or controlled, how do they address or act upon us, and what roles do they play in identity, power, oppression, memory, and everyday life? These questions and more will guide us through the term, and along the way they'll correspond with other popular frameworks for media, including "the media" (the means of mass communication, like broadcasting, publishing, and the internet), "elemental media" (such as earth, water, air, and fire), and even how our bodies become media during communication. 

I do not want and will not expect you to adopt every angle on media studies that we'll try in this course. My hope is you'll identify one approach that resonates well with your interests and ultimately apply it to produce your own content in the final assignment (due by Friday, December 15th). Each week of Media Studies 200 has a theme and primary source(s) that should assist you in that application, and every approach will be "multimodal" in some fashion&#8212;that is, it will invite more than one mode of communication or sensation to combine activities such as hearing, listening, seeing, looking, watching, reading, touching, and playing.

**Questions for Week 1**

Why take a Media Studies course in 2023? What even is Media Studies? And how would you put "material agent" in your own words when describing media? One way to address this question is to focus on glitches, bugs, buffers, breakdowns, and whatnot&#8212;those palpable moments when we realize we're not in complete control of how this becomes that. When have you encountered such resistance in the materials, and what did you do? (Waiting is hard these days.)
