# Notes for Media Studies 200

These notes are intended for students in Media Studies 200. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or correct any of them, especially if you encounter a mistake or typo. Please also inform me if a key point from a given week isn't in the notes.

Consult the [glossary](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/glossary.html) for definitions of key terms in Media Studies. 

## Week 1 (Sept. 7): Media Are Material Agents 

Hello and welcome to Media Studies 200! I designed this course for us to engage four types of media: *audio, images, text, and video*. 

Allow me to define "media." They are *material agents* for *transforming* "this" into "that" by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means. Audio may turn sound into an MP3 file or vinyl record, for instance, and images may turn light or graphics into a photograph or JPG file.

This definition implies that media are subject to the elements. Vinyl records warp in extreme heat, and analog photographs fade in the sun. Digital media decay, degrade, and disappear, too. A [survey](https://zenodo.org/record/8161056) conducted recently by Phil Salvador concluded that "[o]nly 13 percent of classic video games published in the United States are currently in release" (2). If you want to play many of these "lost" games legally, then you'll likely need [access to vintage hardware](https://hcl.library.uvic.ca/). 

These physical aspects of media are the facts of media studies, and media scholars don't have much to study without access to the stuff of audio, images, text, and video. That's merely the start of it. Once we grasp media as materials, we must also learn to approach them critically and responsibly as forms of *mediation* in the world. Doing so enriches our understanding and experience of them. It also improves our chances of producing compelling content in the present moment.  

Surveying critical approaches to media and producing compelling content with them are the primary aims of Media Studies 200. What functions do media serve in interpersonal and mass communication? How are media also artistic or cultural practices? How do we make meaning and construct narratives with media, how are they owned or controlled, how do they address or act upon us, and what roles do they play in identity, power, oppression, memory, and everyday life? These questions and more will guide us through the term, and along the way they'll correspond with other popular frameworks for media, including: 

* "the media" (the means of mass communication, like broadcasting, publishing, and the internet), 
* "elemental media" (such as earth, water, air, and fire), and even
* how our bodies become media during communication. 

I do not want and will not expect you to adopt every angle on media studies that we'll try in this course. My hope is you'll identify one approach that resonates well with your interests and apply it to produce your own content for the final project (due by Friday, December 15th). Each week of Media Studies 200 has a theme and primary source(s) that should assist you in that application, and every approach will be "multimodal" in some fashion&#8212;that is, it will invite more than one mode of communication or sensation to combine activities such as hearing, listening, seeing, looking, watching, reading, touching, and playing.

**Questions for Week 1**

Why take a Media Studies course in 2023? What even is Media Studies? And how would you put "material agent" in your own words when describing media? One way to address this question is to focus on glitches, bugs, buffers, breakdowns, and whatnot&#8212;those palpable moments when we realize we're not in complete control of how this becomes that. When have you encountered such resistance in the materials, and what did you do? (Waiting is hard these days.)

Content warning: flashing text and images; heteronormative romantic or sexual advances.

**Format for Week 1**

Animation (Flash animation) 

**Technique for Week 1**

Denotation: identify and describe four types of media or "material agents" in *M00D*. 

**Approaches addressed in Week 1**

Multimodality, transduction, digital preservation 

## Week 2 (Sept. 11 and 14): Media and Interpersonal Communication

This week, media are not only material agents but also the *middle* of your communication with someone else. Interpersonal communication usually refers to forms of one-to-one, two-way communication, including spoken language, sign language, and body language&#8212;instances when you may very well be the *messenger*. As the name suggests, interpersonal communication stresses in-person or "face-to-face"  communication yet may also involve everyday communications from a distance, like texting and phone calls. We'll talk about the rhetorical situations of interpersonal communication and how they shape the ways we relate to other people. We'll also consider those moments when media enhance interpersonal communication and when we feel like we're shouting into the abyss.  

Critical approaches to media, including interpersonal approaches, are most compelling when they account for *intersectionality* (see, for instance, bell hooks, Brittney Cooper, and Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined ["intersectionality" in 1989](https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf)). Intersectionality "is the study of overlapping or intersecting social identities and related systems of oppression, domination, or discrimination. The theory suggests that—and seeks to examine how—various biological, social and cultural categories such as gender, race, class, ability, sexual orientation, religion, caste, age, nationality and other sectarian axes of identity interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels" ([Syracuse University Libraries 2023](https://researchguides.library.syr.edu/fys101)). Dr. Crenshaw further explains intersectionality in this [2018 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViDtnfQ9FHc).

**Questions for Week 2** 

What to you is an immediate experience? How do media bring personal differences into relation? When do you use media to connect with someone else, and when have media alienated you or made you feel vulnerable? 

**Primary source for Week 2**

Marina Kittaka's [*Secrets Agent*](https://even-kei.itch.io/secrets-agent) (2014), a vignette game with a voice-over track "made pretty loosely and improvisationally" about "this guy [who] stole our gemstone." Content warning: allusions to voice dysphoria and anxiety. 

**Format for Week 2**
