# Glossary of Media Studies Terms

This glossary is intended for reference by students in Media Studies 200. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or correct any of these definitions, especially if you encounter a mistake or typo. Please also inform me if a key term from a given week isn't in the glossary.

You can consult [my notes](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/notes.html) for each week as well. 

## Week 1 (Sept. 7): Media Are Material Agents

* **analog**: a means of reproduction involving the use of continuously variable (rather than discrete) changes in physical properties; print and cassettes are examples of analog reproduction.  
* **audio**: a material agent for transforming sound into records or files by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means; such records include wax cylinders, magnetic tape, cassettes, vinyl records, and compact discs; such files include WAVs, MP3s, and M4As; they reproduce sound through technologies such as speakers, computers (including laptops and smart phones), software (like Audacity, Ableton, Logic, and Audition), televisions, and computer monitors. 
* **denotation**: a literal description of a work's physical characteristics and your sensory experience of them (e.g., what you see, hear, smell, read, watch, touch).
* **digital**: a means of reproduction involving data represented, translated, and transmitted as a series of binary digits or "bits" (1s and 0s); not all computers are digital, but most of them are. 
* **digital preservation**: "combines policies, strategies and actions to ensure access to reformatted and born digital content regardless of the challenges of media failure and technological change. The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time" (see the [Association for Library Collections and Technical Services](https://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408#:~:text=Digital%20preservation%20combines%20policies%2C%20strategies%20and%20actions%20to%20ensure%20access,of%20authenticated%20content%20over%20time.)); for an example of a preservation initiative mentioned during class, see the [Video Game History Foundation](https://gamehistory.org/). 
* **electrical**: a means of reproduction involving electricity, transforming the energy of electrical current into another form of energy, such as light or heat; manual or "hand-cranked" turntables don't require electricity, for example; neither do pinhole cameras or all-mechanical cameras.
* **elemental media**: material agents, such as earth, water, air, and fire, that do not require digital or electrical technology to transform "this" into "that"; in [*The Marvelous Clouds*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo20069392.html), John Durham Peters describes elemental media as "the elements that lie at the taken-for-granted base of our habits and habitat" (1).
* **format**: a way in which media are arranged, designed, and even compressed, usually for circulation via a means of communication like broadcasting, publishing, and the internet; in [*MP3: The Meaning of a Format*](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1663/MP3The-Meaning-of-a-Format), Jonathan Sterne observes that "[f]ormat denotes a whole range of decisions that affect the look, feel, experience, and workings of a medium. It also names a set of rules according to which a technology can operate" (7).
* **image**: a material agent for transforming light or graphics into pictures or files by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means; such pictures include paintings, drawings, photographs, cartoons, and graphs; such files include PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs, and PDFs; light and graphics are reproduced through technologies such as cameras, projectors, computers (including laptops and smart phones), software (like Photoshop, Canva, GIMP, and PowerPoint), televisions, and computer monitors. 
* **mechanical**: a means of reproduction involving gears, motors, and other moving physical parts to transform mechanical energy into another form of energy; early phonography mechanically reproduced sound, for example, by converting mechanical energy into acoustical energy; in [*Scripts, Grooves, and Writing Machines*](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=356), Lisa Gitelman underscores how "[m]echanical reproductions . . . are themselves performative and inscriptive. Experiences of them change according to available categories of representation. The first scratchy phonograph records, for instance,reportedly sounded 'just like' the sounds they recorded" (18); conversely, most people today would probably describe those early records (from the 1870s and '80s) as "low fidelity" reproductions. 
* **media**: material agents for transforming "this" into "that" by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means; my use of "'this' into 'that'" is inspired by Wendy Chun's ["The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future Is a Memory"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/595632); Matthew Fuller's chapter, "How This Becomes That," in [*Media Ecologies*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262562263/media-ecologies/); and Jonathan Sterne's approach to transducers in [*The Audible Past*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-audible-past).    
* **media, the**: the means of mass communication, like broadcasting, publishing, and the internet; in the ninth edition of [*Media and Communication in Canada*](https://learninglink.oup.com/access/gasher9e), Mike Gasher, David Skinner, and Natalie Coulter unpack how "the media" is associated historically with "the press" in many Western countries; they then note that "the media generally represent the interests of the power elites in society&#8212;mostly business types, but also the agendas of the political and intellectual elites. While newspaper readership has declined in recent years, the electronic media that dominate our lives today are very much a product of this history. Controlled by corporate interests, the profit motive plays a strong role in shaping media form and content. Still, however, . . . media continue to provide a key link between people, governments, and the larger society in which they live" (39).
* **multimodal**: inviting more than one mode of communication or sensation to combine activities such as hearing, listening, seeing, looking, watching, reading, touching, and playing; in "All Writing Is Multimodal," Cheryl Ball and Colin Charlton write, "[a]ny combination of modes makes a multimodal text, and all texts&#8212;every piece of communication a human composes&#8212;use more than one mode. Thus, all writing is multimodal" (42).
* **text**: a material agent for transforming marks (such as lines) into alphanumeric characters or files by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means; such characters may be analog (print) or digital; such files include DOCX, RTF, TXT, and ODT; marks and characters are reproduced through technologies such as keyboards, projectors, computers (including laptops and smart phones), software (like word processors, text editors, Photoshop, and PowerPoint), televisions, and computer monitors; this definition of text as media differs from the treatment of text as a methodological field (where, say, a wrestling match or cooking livestream might be a cultural "text" subject to interpretation or decoding) in publications such as Roland Barthes's ["From Work to Text."](https://www.d.umn.edu/~cstroupe/handouts/8500/barthes_work_to_text.pdf)
* **transduction**: the action or process of converting something, especially energy or a message, into another form or format; in [*The Audible Past*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-audible-past), Jonathan Sterne writes, "modern technologies of sound reproduction use devices called *transducers*, which turn sound into something else and that something else back into sound. All sound-reproduction technologies work through the use of transducers. Telephones turn your voice into electricity, sending it down a phone line and turning it back into sound at the other end. Radio works on a similar principle but uses waves instead of wires. The diaphragm and stylus of a cylinder phonograph change sound through a process of inscription in tinfoil, wax, or any number of other surfaces. On playback, the stylus and diaphragm transduce the inscriptions back into sounds. Digital sound-reproduction technologies all use transducers; they simply add another level of transformation, converting electric current into a series of zeros and ones (and back again)" (22).
* **video**: a material agent for transforming moving images with or without audio and text into records or files by mechanical, electrical, digital, and/or analog means; such records include VHS, compact discs, and DVDs; such files include FLV, GIF, MOV, and MP4; moving images are reproduced through technologies such as projectors, computers (including laptops and smart phones), software (like Premiere, Final Cut, iMovie, and Flash), televisions, and computer monitors; see Audrey Amidon's work at [*The Unwritten Record*](https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2013/06/25/film-preservation-101-whats-the-difference-between-a-film-and-a-video/) for more on the physical differences between video and film; Amidon writes, "The most basic difference between the physical object of film and the physical object of a video is whether it is light-readable or you need a machine to see what's on it. If you unwind a bit of a reel of film and hold it to a light source, you'll see individual images (called frames). . . . The video tape requires a machine in order to view it, because the visual information is an electronic signal that is recorded magnetically to a piece of tape."

## Week 2 (Sept. 11 and 14): Media and Interpersonal Communication

* **affordance theory**: the treatment of media as a relation between animals (human and nonhuman) and their environment; it offers an alternative to the assumption that design and use are "baked" into media or that media have homogeneous or uniform effects (regardless of who interacts with them); in [*The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-u5hmFOvOM2Civ4Gz/page/n19/mode/2up), James J. Gibson provides a framework for affordance theory: "[t]he affordances of the environment are what it *offers* the animal, what it *provides* or *furnishes*, either for good or ill. The verb to *afford* is found in the dictionary, the noun *affordance* is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment" (127). 
* **back stage**: the space where "performance is prepared" in the dramaturgy model of interpersonal communication ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/dramaturgy/)); see Erving Goffman's [*The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/708488/) for more on this term; importantly, the boundaries between the front and back stage of performance are often blurred; a course on Zoom, where our homes are integrated with the online classroom and you get to meet my cat, is an example of such blurred boundaries.
* **dramaturgy**: "[a] sociological perspective on identity that employs a theatrical metaphor to explore issues of identity formation, reformation and performance, and as such, assumes a place, a moment, and an audience to whom the identity is being presented" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/back-matter/glossary/)); "[a] key element of dramaturgy is the concept of the front- and backstage. In face-to-face interactions, the front- and backstage are two related but separate areas, where the front is the space in which the performance of self takes place, and the back is where that performance is prepared" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/dramaturgy/)); work on dramaturgy in media and communication studies frequently draws from Erving Goffman's [*The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/708488/the-presentation-of-self-in-everyday-life-by-erving-goffman/); the dramaturgy model is most useful when studying the roles or "characters" people play in the organizational communication of formal institutions like governments and schools.  
* **front stage**: the space where "the performance of self takes place" in the dramaturgy model of interpersonal communication ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/dramaturgy/)); see Erving Goffman's [*The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/708488/) for more on this term; importantly, the boundaries between the front and back stage of performance are often blurred; a course on Zoom, where our homes are integrated with the online classroom and you get to meet my cat, is an example of such blurred boundaries. 
* **game design document (GDD)**: in [*Game Design Workshop*](https://www.gamedesignworkshop.com/), Tracy Fullerton writes: "The game industry has no standard organization for documenting designs. It would be nice if there were a set formula or style to follow, like the standards for screenplays or architectural blueprints, but this simply does not exist. Everyone does agree that a good design document needs to contain all the details required to create a game; however, what those details are will be affected by the specifics of the game itself. In general, the contents of a design document can be broken up into the following areas: overview and vision statement[;] audience, platform, and marketing[;] gameplay[;] characters (if applicable)[;] story (if applicable)[;] world (if applicable)[;] media list" (447); Mike Sellers's ["Game Design Concept and Pitch Template"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-yiF2Pq-OgJaTXsMAQbIckoDzGINz26O/view) and ["Detailed Game Design Documentation Template"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-51Uwxqle3DZVleir6OhDlWA_aerw5g/view) are useful starting points for game design docs. 
* **impression management**: "the overt and the unconscious strategies we, as social individuals, deploy to try and influence how others perceive us" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/back-matter/glossary/)); "[b]y successfully managing impressions, an individual not only receives positive reaction from their peers or social group, and thus peer esteem, but it also allows for a consistent presentation of self – that is, an individual creates and maintains a consistent story of who 'they' are – the story of 'Kate the friend' or 'Tama the student'" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/impressions-management/)); work on impression management in media and communication studies frequently draws from Erving Goffman's [*The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/708488/the-presentation-of-self-in-everyday-life-by-erving-goffman/); impression management is most useful when studying interpersonal and mass communication strategies for self-branding (or "defining your brand") on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. 
* **interpersonal communication**: usually one-to-one communication, including "face-to-face" and remote communication, with an emphasis on rhetoric and spoken, body, and sign language
* **intersectionality**: "the study of overlapping or intersecting social identities and related systems of oppression, domination, or discrimination. The theory suggests that—and seeks to examine how—various biological, social and cultural categories such as gender, race, class, ability, sexual orientation, religion, caste, age, nationality and other sectarian axes of identity interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels" ([Syracuse University Libraries 2023](https://researchguides.library.syr.edu/fys101)); Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term in 1989 in ["Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex"](https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf) and further explains intersectionality in this [2018 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViDtnfQ9FHc); Kishonna L. Gray's [*Intersectional Tech: Black Users in Digital Gaming*](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/intersectional-tech/) is one example of an intersectional approach to media. 
* **looking-glass self**: "[t]he looking-glass-model considers the self as constantly reworking itself through a three-step process of imagining how we appear to others, how others judge that appearance, and then developing the self in light of that (hypothetical) judgement" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/back-matter/glossary/)); "[t]he looking-glass-self is particularly interesting to think about in terms of mediated interactions, whether that be a letter, a talk-show, or a Reddit thread. Because mediated communication involves distance, the individual users become more or less isolated depending on the form of mediation, and the social relationship of interaction becomes stripped of some or many of the subconscious and non-verbal cues with which we often rely upon to moderate our reactions. Particularly in two-way, mediated exchanges, such as phone, text or chat, users often have to imagine the 'reflection' they are having on another’s mind" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/looking-glass-self/)); Charles Horton Cooley coined the term in 1902 in [*Human Nature and the Social Order*](https://archive.org/details/humannaturesocia00cooluoft); the looking-glass self tends to overlook not only systemic issues like discrimination but also differences between types of social and cultural groups, with far more attention to "fit" than nonconformity, but it's still somewhat common in social media discourse.  
* **mechanics** (in the design and study of video games): "verbs" that allow a game's elements to interact and influence the state of the game; these verbs are typically understood as player character actions like running, jumping, and speaking that afford interaction with the game's environment and non-player characters (NPCs); "core" mechanics are verbs used repetitively to reach a rewarded game state; a game's set of mechanics and how that set feels to players is often called "gameplay"; for more on mechanics as verbs, see Anna Anthropy and Naomi Clark's [*A Game Design Vocabulary*](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321886927/samplepages/0321886925.pdf); for more on mechanics and types of mechanics, see [Miguel Sicart](https://gamestudies.org/0802/articles/sicart).
* **parallel play**: "[a] form of play during which two children engage in similar play activities in proximity to each other without sharing thoughts, play goals, or engaging in play together" (Michael O. Brigano in the [*Encyclopedia of Child Behavior and Development*](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-79061-9_2073)); while parallel play is associated with children's activities, it's also popular among adults: playing video games next to each other on separate consoles in the same room, for instance.
* **player character** (or playable character): "[m]any games will have a character that you, the player, control through the adventures and challenges of the experience. This character is the player's link to the story, action, and gameplay of the gaming experience. Depending on the game genre and style, [the player character] may be a customizable character . . .  or a prebuilt character [who] is part of the existing lore and story. Player characters can be a blank slate, a fictional character, or based on real-life individuals. Sometimes referred to as an avatar, the player character is your physical representation in the game world" (see Deconstruction Gaming's ["Player Character - What is a Player Character in Gaming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MqSmToyuwU)); a non-player character or non-playable character (NPC) is a character who isn't controlled by the player. 
* **rhetoric**: "any communication used to modify the perspectives of others" (the [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/rhetorical_situation/index.html)); "primarily an awareness of the language choices we make" (["Purdue OWL: Introduction to Rhetoric"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIESu4yXco4)); [*Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy*](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/) is an example of where media studies meets rhetoric: "Since its first issue in January of 1996, the mission of *Kairos* has been to publish scholarship that examines digital and multimodal composing practices, promoting work that enacts its scholarly argument through rhetorical and innovative uses of new media."
* **symbolic interactionism**: "the concern with the construction of identity within a social context, how an identity is presented and re-presented within a given social or communicative situation" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/back-matter/glossary/)); George Herbert Mead's [*Mind, Self, and Society*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo20099389.html) is a key work in the area; the looking-glass self and impression management are associated with symbolic interactionism, which may be useful for studying the dynamics of a particular interpersonal communication but mostly overlooks macro-level or systemic issues in society and culture. 

## Week 3 (Sept. 18 and 21): Media and Mass Communication

* **acousmatic voice**: an "offscreen" voice; the speaker is heard but not seen; in [*Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen*](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/audio-vision-sound-on-screen/9780231185899), Michel Chion writes, "Acousmatic sound draws our attention to sound traits normally hidden from us by the simultaneous sight of the causes&#8212;hidden because this sight reinforces the perception of certain elements of the sound and obscures others. The acousmatic truly allows sound to reveal itself in all its dimensions" (32).
* **amb (ambiences)**: background or ambient sound in a work; may be diegetic (heard by characters in the world of the work), non-diegetic (not heard by characters in the world of the work), or extra-diegetic (heard across the world of the work and the world beyond it); effectively synonymous with bg (background) sound. 
* **bg (background)**: ambient or background sound in a work; may be diegetic (heard by characters in the world of the work), non-diegetic (not heard by characters in the world of the work), or extra-diegetic (heard across the world of the work and the world beyond it);  effectively synonymous with amb (ambiences). 
* **causal listening**: "listening," according to Michel Chion in [*Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen*](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/audio-vision-sound-on-screen/9780231185899), "to a sound in order to gather information about its cause (or source)" (25).
* **convergence**: "the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted. Convergence is a word that manages to describe technological, industrial, cultural, and social changes, depending on who's speaking and what they think they are talking about. In the world of media convergence, every important story gets told, every brand gets sold, every consumer gets courted across multiple media platforms" (see [Henry Jenkins](http://henryjenkins.org/blog/2006/06/welcome_to_convergence_culture.html)).
* **dx (dialogue)**: the sound of dialogue (between characters) in a work; usually diegetic (heard by characters in the world of the work), but characters may converse extra-diegetically with voice-over narrators, for instance. 
* **fol (Foley sounds)**: Foley sounds, such as footsteps, performed by artists using materials and props in sync with (moving) images; usually diegetic (heard by characters in the world of the work); see the video, ["The Magic of Making Sound,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO3N_PRIgX0) for more on the history and practice of Foley. 
* **mass communication**: usually one-to-many communication, with an emphasis on the press or the media, including entertainment and advertising; the production of mass communication may be centralized or decentralized.
* **mx (music)**: the sound of music in a work; may be diegetic (heard by characters in the world of the work), non-diegetic (not heard by characters in the world of the work), or extra-diegetic (heard across the world of the work and the world beyond it).
* **reduced listening**: listening that, according to Michel Chion in [*Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen*](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/audio-vision-sound-on-screen/9780231185899), "focuses on the traits of the sound itself, independent of its cause and of its meaning. Reduced listening takes the sound&#8212;verbal, played on an instrument, noises, or whatever&#8212;as itself the object to be observed instead of as a vehicle for something else" (29).
* **recontextualization**: when, according to Henry Jenkins in [*Textual Poachers*](https://www.routledge.com/Textual-Poachers-Television-Fans-and-Participatory-Culture/Jenkins/p/book/9780415533294), fans fill the gaps of broadcast material or write their own backstories for characters in that material; common in fan fiction and "fix fic" in particular. 
* **semantic listening**: listening, according to Michel Chion in [*Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen*](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/audio-vision-sound-on-screen/9780231185899), "to a code or a language to interpret a message: spoken language, of course, as well as Morse and other such codes" (28). 
* **sfx (sound effects)**: the sound effects in a work; may be diegetic (heard by characters in the world of the work), non-diegetic (not heard by characters in the world of the work), or extra-diegetic (heard across the world of the work and the world beyond it).
* **social model of communication**: "emphasizes social and media-related variables that inform the process of communication. The larger social environment or milieu within which message formulation takes place is termed the *encoding context*. At the other end, the *decoding context* represents the ideas and understandings that the decoder brings to deciphering the encoded message. . . . From this perspective, successful communication is always contingent on the sender and receiver sharing some common idea or notion of the process or subject of communication, particularly in terms of language and experience" (Gasher, Skinner, and Coulter's [*Media and Communication in Canada*](https://learninglink.oup.com/access/gasher9e)), 12-13); this model is quite linear even as it accounts for social and cultural contexts. 
* **transmission model of communication** (also called the mathematical theory or Shannon-Weaver model of communication): a "source" (usually a person) communicates a message to a  transmitter (like a telephone or camera) as a signal through a channel (like wires or light) to a receiver (like a telephone or screen) that reconstructs the original message for a "destination" (the person for whom the message was intended) with as little physical and semantic noise as possible; the "destination" may then provide feedback and thus become a new "source" of communication (see [Claude Shannon](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf), [Shannon and Warren Weaver](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p725487), and Chapter 1 of Gasher, Skinner, and Coulter's [*Media and Communication in Canada*](https://learninglink.oup.com/access/gasher9e)); this model is quite linear and effectively ignores social and cultural contexts, but it's foundational to early information theory.  
* **two-step flow**: "an intermediary between the sender of a message and the audience. This intermediary, dubbed an 'opinion leader,' [is] usually a person of influence with greater access to information. They would be seen as an authority able to filter, interpret and explain media messages. It is the credibility of the weatherman that persuades the individual to bring along an umbrella, rather than the factual data from the meteorological department themselves. And it would be the community or religious leader expounding on the messages released by politicians that actually hold sway over the masses" ([*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/two-step-flow-of-communication/)); Paul Lazarsfeld coined the term in 1944 and developed it with Elihu Katz in the 1955 book, [*Personal Influence: The Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications*](https://www.routledge.com/Personal-Influence-The-Part-Played-by-People-in-the-Flow-of-Mass-Communications/Katz-Lazarsfeld-Roper/p/book/9781412805070); the two-step flow model questions (for good reason) whether media effects are direct and communication is linear. 
* **voice-over**: to paraphrase Sarah Kozloff in [*Invisible Storytellers: Voice-over Narration in American Fiction Film*](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520067936/invisible-storytellers), voice-over is what is said by a speaker who is either not seen or is communicating from a moment before or after what is being seen.
* 
## Week 4 (Sept. 25 and 28): Media and Communication as Culture

* **annotation**: a comment or explanation added to media; Nick Sousanis's [visual analysis projects](https://spinweaveandcut.com/visual-analysis-examples/) involve the annotation of comics, for example.

* **agenda-setting theory**: a media effects theory; it claims that the media "have," in the words of Maxwell McCombs and Sebastian Valenzuela, "strong, direct effects in the short term by influencing not what people think, but what they think about. . . . [A] central assertion of agenda-setting theory is that those aspects emphasized in the news come to be regarded by the public over time as being important. In other words, the media agenda sets the public agenda," and the "most prominent public issues" become the "most important public issues" (see the preface to [*Setting the Agenda: Mass Media and Public Opinion*](https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=setting-the-agenda-mass-media-and-public-opinion-3rd-edition--9781509535798)); this theory is frequently associated with the work of McCombs as well as Walter Lippmann. 

* **cultivation theory**: another media effects theory; it claims that "watching a great deal of television will be associated," in the words of James Shanahan and Michael Morgan, "with a tendency to hold specific and distinct conceptions of reality, conceptions that are congruent with the most consistent and pervasive images and values of the medium" ([*Television and Its Viewers*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/television-and-its-viewers/83C017F8F8416B5D5F2716EBE5D354BF) 3); reviewing the work of cultivation theorist, George Gerbner, Mark Dixon adds that "media consumption leads audiences to accept mainstream ideologies. . . . Media violence defines powerless characters [and] . . . powerful characters. . . . News reportage stigmatises key groups. . . . Audience protest is subjugated" ([*Media Theory for A Level*](https://www.routledge.com/Media-Theory-for-A-Level-The-Essential-Revision-Guide/Dixon/p/book/9780367145439?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvL-oBhCxARIsAHkOiu3XAl5SwKJ9o6585JUuDgxRvq1Beb07MKO_9JanwJzQGQBstDDUAg4aAt7HEALw_wcB) 181-82); television in particular causes audiences to believe the world is more violent or dangerous than it is, a tendency Gerbner calls "mean world syndrome" (180).

* **cultural studies**: the study of by whom, for whom, how, under what assumptions, and to what effects media are made and reproduced through everyday activities and cultural practices, with attention to hegemony, "common sense," and intersectionality; in "Encoding, Decoding" for instance, Stuart Hall outlines several ways to communicate with and against dominant systems of meaning in mass communication: "dominant-hegemonic" (communicating with the grain of the dominant system), "professional" (reproducing the dominant system through seemingly neutral skills in the workplace), "negotiated" (simultaneously adapting and opposing the dominant system), and oppositional (rejecting the dominant system by creating or adopting an alternative system) (see Chapter 34 of Simon During's [*The Cultural Studies Reader*](https://www.routledge.com/The-Cultural-Studies-Reader/During/p/book/9780415374132) 515-17); you might contrast cultural studies with media effects research. 

* **hegemony**: a key concept in media and cultural studies associated with the work of Antonio Gramsci; Joseph V. Femia observes the following in ["The Concept of Hegemony"](https://academic.oup.com/book/5347/chapter/148120180): "Gramsci states that the supremacy of a social group or class manifests itself in two different ways: 'domination' (*dominio*), or coercion, and 'intellectual and moral leadership' (*direzione intellettuale e morale*). This latter type of supremacy constitutes hegemony. Social control, in other words, takes two basic forms: besides influencing behaviour and choice externally, through rewards and punishments, it also affects them internally, by moulding personal convictions into a replica of prevailing norms. Such 'internal control' is based on hegemony, which refers to an order in which a common social-moral language is spoken, in which one concept of reality is dominant, informing with its spirit all modes of thought and behaviour. It follows that hegemony is the predominance obtained by consent rather than force of one class or group over other classes" (23-4). 

* **media effects research**: a form of media and communication studies that privileges the impact of media on society and culture, often by treating media as causes; those causes may be direct (e.g., they cause passive audiences to think or behave in particular ways), minimal (e.g., they merely reinforce people's existing beliefs or behaviours), or third-person (e.g., people perceive them to affect others but not themselves); for examples of media effects research, see agenda-setting theory, cultivation theory, social, and uses and gratification theory; scientific or quantitative methods are common in media effects research.  

* **representation**: a "'reflective' school of thought" where, according to Mark Dixon, "the media acts like a mirror&#8212;capturing and relaying a faithful version of the real world to audiences everywhere. The joy of consuming media, in this sense, is that it can take us to places we have never been to. The media provides a window to the world, a faithful and accurate means of reproducing information that we might ordinarily be unable to access. Accordingly, the job of media professionals . . . is to observe and record these inaccessible wonders so that audiences at home can similarly bear witness" ([*Media Theory for A Level*](https://www.routledge.com/Media-Theory-for-A-Level-The-Essential-Revision-Guide/Dixon/p/book/9780367145439?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvL-oBhCxARIsAHkOiu3XAl5SwKJ9o6585JUuDgxRvq1Beb07MKO_9JanwJzQGQBstDDUAg4aAt7HEALw_wcB) 60-1); research in cultural studies examines how representations reflect power and result in stereotypes as well as exclusions; power, in this cases, is when the media treats hegemony as reality or "common sense" (i.e., something audiences are meant to simply accept rather than question). 

* **ritual view of communication**: according to James Carey, "[i]n a ritual definition, communication is linked to terms such as 'sharing,' 'participation, 'association,''fellowship,' and 'the possession of a common faith.' This definition exploits the ancient identity and common roots of the terms 'commonness,' 'communion,' 'communify,' and 'communication.' A ritual view of communication is directed not toward the extension of messages in space but toward the maintenance of society in time; not the act of imparting information but the representation of shared beliefs. . . . "Under a ritual view, then, news is not information but drama. It does not describe.the world but portrays an arena of dramatic forces and action; it exists solely in historical time; and it invites our participation on the basis of our assuming, often vicariously, social roles within it" ([*Communication as Culture*](https://www.routledge.com/Communication-as-Culture-Revised-Edition-Essays-on-Media-and-Society/Carey/p/book/9780415989763) 18, 21); communication here is everyday; it's the "ambience of human existence" (22); the ritual view "sees the original or highest manifestation of communication not in the transmission of intelligent information but in the construction and maintenance of an ordered, meaningful cultural world that can serve as a control and container for human action" (18); it also claims that communication *produces* reality and doesn't just describe or reflect it (25).

* **social learning theory**: another media effects theory; it claims a link between individual behaviour and media consumption and, stronger, that media models behaviours that people observe and replicate; Albert Bandura argues in [*Social Learning Theory*](https://web.archive.org/web/20131024214846/http://www.jku.at/org/content/e54521/e54528/e54529/e178059/Bandura_SocialLearningTheory_ger.pdf) that "modeling phenomena are governed by four interrelated subprocesses": "attentional processes" (people select aspects of the model), "retentional processes" (people memorize aspects of the model), "motor reproduction processes" (people's behaviours reproduce or mimic aspects of the model), and "reinforcement and motivational processes" (people are incentivized to reproduce or mimic aspects of the model) (6-8).

* **uses and gratification theory**: another media effects theory; it focuses on mass communication and claims that people pursue media that satisfy their wants and needs and thus ignore media that do not; such wants and needs may be cognitive, affective,  integrative (personally or socially), or somatic (e.g., relaxation) (see [*Media Studies 101*](https://opentextbc.ca/mediastudies101/chapter/uses-and-gratifications-model/_ for more).
