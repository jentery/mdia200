# Worksheet 3

This is your third of four worksheets in MDIA 200, and it covers material from Weeks 7, 8, and 9 (Oct. 16 - Nov. 2) of class. Your response is due via Brightspace by the end of Week 10: Friday, November 10th at noon.

The worksheet is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use your notes, assigned primary sources, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

*Please ensure you cite your source material.* 

## Download the Worksheet 

Please [download the worksheet](mdia200Worksheet3.docx) (DOCX format) to complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac. You are also welcome to copy the prompts and paste them into a word processor. I do not recommend this approach because it's riskier than simply downloading the worksheet. If you do decide to copy and paste the prompts, then please ensure you include the Academic Integrity statement and a list of works cited (see below) in your response before you submit it. 

If you need the worksheet in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the worksheet does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* completing the worksheet. 

## Format

This open-book worksheet contains *eight* short-answer prompts, totaling 100 points. Responses to prompts in Section 1 are each worth 10 points, and responses to prompts in Section 2 are each worth 15 points. 

## Academic Integrity 

By responding to this worksheet, you confirm that: 

* You followed UVic academic regulations and observed standards of academic integrity (e.g., no plagiarism or cheating). 
* You completed this worksheet individually.
* Each response to every prompt is your own, excluding quoted and paraphrased material that is clearly cited. 
* You cited any sources, including assigned course material and internet sources, that you used to address the prompts. 

## Section 1 (10 points each)

Please do not use more than *225 words* per response. (I will use a word-counting tool during assessment.) Do not include audio, images, or video in your responses. Your examples should be specific, citable, and drawn from course material between Weeks 1 and 9. By "course material," I mean assigned primary sources, lectures, class discussions, and the course website, including the notes and glossary. You are welcome and in fact encouraged to quote definitions in your responses, but please cite your sources, including the course website (see "Citing Your Sources" below for details). 

1. What is affect? Use an example from the course material to explain its importance.  
2. What are semiotics? Use an example from the course material to explain their importance. 
3. What is environmental storytelling? Use an example from the course material to explain its importance. 
4. What's the difference between a story and a narrative? Use an example from the course material to explain this difference. 

## Section 2 (15 points each)

Please do not use more than *300 words* per response. (I will use a word-counting tool during assessment.) You are welcome to embed or attach audio, images, and video files as examples of content "outside the course material." These files may be your own, but please cite them if they are not. By "course material," I mean assigned primary sources, lectures, class discussions, and the course website, including the notes and glossary. Again, please cite your sources, including the course website (see "Citing Your Sources" below for details).

<ol start=5>
<li>What is mimetic communication? Use an example <em>outside</em> the course material to explain its importance.</li>
<li>Kamla says the following in Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle": "Sometimes interpretation is a trap. Sometimes we need to simply observe" (23). Could Kamla's remark be understood as a criticism of semiotics? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Describe a moment when you felt a "shared pulse" while experiencing a particular work of media with other people. What role did affect play in the experience, and what was social or shared about it? Be sure to identify and cite the work. It can be a video game, comic, tv show, animation, podcast, or livestream.</li>   
<li>Please use storyboarding to transform the experience of playing a video game of your choice into a narrative of your choice. The narrative should consist of at least three "shots" or scenes, with equilibrium, disruption, and a new equilibrium. Be sure to embed or attach your storyboard.</li>
</ol>
  
## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess each of your responses in Sections 1 and 2. 

* 9-10 points (Section 1) and 14-15 points (Section 2): the response is compelling, and it enriches or enhances the course material (exceeds all expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive ("original insight")
* 8 points (Section 1) and 12-13 points (Section 2): the response is compelling and corresponds with the course material (exceeds some or most expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 7 points (Section 1) and 11 points (Section 2): the response corresponds with the course material (meets expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, and occasionally convincing 
* 6 points (Section 1) and 9-10 points (Section 2:) the response corresponds with some of the course material (meets some expectations); the use of an example warrants some clarification  
* 1-5 points (Section 1) and 1-8 points (Section 2): the response does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material and/or there's no example
* 0 points: no response  

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

10 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no works cited page is included at the end of the worksheet (see details below).

The total of these points (0-100) will constitute 20% of your final mark in this course. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each response to earn a high mark.* 

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw examples and definitions. Here are MLA reference entries for the course site and the primary sources for Weeks 7, 8, and 9 (just be sure to change the access date to correspond with your date of access):
