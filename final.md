# Final Project: Proof of Concept (DRAFT)

This is a draft prompt for the final project in this course. 

## Purpose of the Assignment 

The purpose of this assignment is for you to demonstrate what you've learned in this course by using media to produce compelling content about an issue or problem that's not only pertinent to Media Studies but also important to you, your community, or your academic work. 

## A Proof of Concept 

Given the time constraints of this course, not to mention the fact that it's a 200-level class, your response to this prompt should only be a "proof of concept." 

A proof of concept in Media Studies demonstrates the feasibility of a project by creating and sharing a *part* of it for feedback prior to proceeding with all of it. A proof of concept tests an idea and shows people why it will work. Sometimes people call it a demo or pilot, and it's associated with prototypes and "vertical slices."

## Media You Should Use 

You may *not* produce a proof of concept for: 

* An essay, 
* Propaganda, or
* An advertisement or advertising campaign.  

But your proof of concept may consist of:

* A video (say, 4-12 minutes).
* Audio (say, 4-12 minutes).
* A series of images (say, 5-30 of them).
* A technical or gameplay demo (say, 1-3 scenes of a game).
* Any of the above accompanied by text (say, 150-500 words).

The numbers in parentheses are guidelines intended to reduce your project's scope as well as the time and labour you spend on it. 

Your proof of concept should be accompanied by a concise description (~250 words) of the issue it's addressing, its intended audience, and its context, technique, approach, and messaging. See details about each of these below.  

## Steps You Might Follow

You're welcome to follow these steps to produce your proof of concept: 

1. **Review**. Review what you learned in this course. 
2. **Interests**. Identify an area or two of the course material that interests you personally or academically (or both!). What, in short, is something you care about? What might motivate you to produce a compelling proof of concept that you're proud of or invested in? 
3. **Issue or problem**. Connect those interests with an issue or problem pertinent to Media Studies. It could be something we discussed in class, but it doesn't have to be. Here are some examples that come to mind (obviously not an exhaustive list); any of them could become the focus of your proof of concept:  
   * The role of intersectionality or hegemony in content produced by marginalized people.
   * How to study the shared pulse of affect, including the ways media affect people's capacity to act. 
   * The role of habits or rituals (as opposed to the transmission of information) in the production of shared beliefs and community. 
   * The question of what, if anything, media "cause" or determine (e.g., violence). 
   * The ways the meaning of media is policed by fans, scholars, artists, and intermediaries. 
   * An issue not addressed by the course material that's nevertheless pertinent to Media Studies in the 21st century. After all, we didn't and couldn't cover everything. 
4. **Source material**. Determine whether you're creating a primary or secondary source for your proof of concept. "Primary Sources are immediate, first-hand accounts of a topic, from people who had a direct connection with it." "Secondary sources are one step removed from primary sources, though they often quote or otherwise use primary sources. They can cover the same topic, but add a layer of interpretation and analysis" (definitions care of [Healey Library at UMass](https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary)). You are welcome to engage [primary sources we studied in this course](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/#materials), but you are certainly not expected to do so. Your proof of concept simply needs to be relevant to Media Studies. 
5. **Context and audience**. Now situate your interests (Step 2) and issue or problem (Step 3) in a context with an audience for your proof of concept. Your sense of context and audience should be as specific as possible to help you reduce your project's scope. Here are some examples of what I mean: 
   * Not "students" but "undergraduates in Media Studies 200 at UVic" or "students in the Society for Students with a Disability (SSD)."
   * Not "gamers" but "people active at r/gaymers." 
   * Not "tv fans" but "fans of science fiction horror and thrillers such as *Stranger Things*, *Kindred*, and *Returnal*."
6. **Media and mode of address**. Once you have a sense of context, consider how you want your proof of concept to address your intended audience and the issue or problem you identified. You can approach this step by privileging your audience and the context: which media or formats are popular among your audience or expected in this situation? Or you can rely on what you know best and how you prefer to communicate: whether you're most comfortable with audio, image, video, or text, for instance. Do you want your audience to listen, read, watch, look, participate . . . ? Will you address them directly (the second-person "you")? Will you use first-person pronouns ("I" and "we") to communicate with them? 
7. **Technique**. Selecting a technique will render Steps 1-6 actionable. It helps to have a method or procedure for turning this idea into that proof of concept. We experimented with some techniques in class, and a long (but not exhaustive) list of techniques appears at the bottom of this prompt. Review that list to see which techniques are familiar to you and which ones you might want to research for your project. To help you get started, here are a few grounded examples that point to proofs of concept for both primary and secondary source materials (I refer to primary sources from class to render these examples familiar to you; but again, your proof of concept does not have to address a primary source from class): 
    * Use imitation (technique) to mimic the style and composition of "Translated, From the Japanese" to tell your own story about relocating to Canada. This imitation would be a secondary source. 
    * Use a mix (technique) in a theatre or club setting to introduce animators to the music of Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries and their influences. This mix would likely be a primary source. 
    * Use a reaction video (technique) to document the affective experience of playing *Hair Nah*. This reaction video would likely be a primary source. 
    * Use a branching-scenario prototype (technique) to adapt the story of "Message in a Bottle" into a Twine or Bitsy game. This adaptation would likely be a primary source. 
    * Use annotation (technique) to decode the lighting and mise-en-scène of *Biidaaban*. This annotation would be a secondary source. 
    * Use acousmatics (technique) to interview Marina Kittaka about *Secrets Agent* for a podcast about vignette games. This interview would be a primary source. 
    * Use an event score (technique) to provide fans of *Within the Wires* with instructions to stage their own stories in the fictitious world of the Institute. This event score would be a primary source. 
    * Use provenance tracing (technique) to describe the labour and materials required to make a game like *Umurangi Generation*. This tracing would likely be a secondary source. 
8. **Approach**. A technique is even more compelling when you articulate it with a critical approach. Select *one or two such approaches from the course material* that best describe your work in the proof of concept. You might find it easier to identify your approach first and then follow it with a technique, thus reversing the order of Steps 7 and 8 here. That's totally fine. Either way, here are some examples of articulating a technique with approaches from class: 
    * Imitation: intermedia, media aesthetics, and/or semiotics 
    * Mix: the shared pulse of affect, cultivation theory, uses and gratification, and/or agenda-setting 
    * Reaction video: mimetic communication, reflective model of culture, and/or ritual view of culture 
    * Branching-scenario prototype: narrative, media convergence, and/or uses and gratification  
    * Annotation: semiotics and/or two-step flow 
    * Acousmatics: impressions management, transmission model of communication, and/or dramaturgy
    * Event score: intermedia, social learning, dramaturgy, environmental storytelling, and/or ritual view of culture 
    * Provenance tracing: economy of media and/or naturalization model of culture 
9. **Messaging**. We're almost there. Before you start producing content, describe how your proof of concept will communicate a message. First, what's the message? Can you state it in a sentence or two? Second, what if you place your communication style on a spectrum from implicit to explicit or indirect to direct? How subtle or forward is your messaging? Finally, to what degree are you ("your voice") communicating the message, and to what degree are your media doing so? Recall how media are material agents. This means they package or automate aspects of communication but also have material or physical connotations. Consider, for instance, how stop-motion animations like *Biidaaban* may connote "depth," "tactility," or "indexical signs" while text animations like *THE M00D* may connote "flat," "intangibility," or "symbolic signs." 
10. **Get cooking**. Start working on your proof of concept and seek feedback along the way. Note that you'll have time during class in late November and early December to work on your proof of concept and workshop it with peers. Worksheet 4 will also include a prompt that will nudge you to start planning and describing your project before December arrives. 

## Expectations 

Here are some expectations implied by this prompt: 
* **Time**: Once you've followed steps 1-9 above, I recommend spending 3-6 hours on your proof of concept.
* **Instructions**: I will assume you read this prompt and these instructions for the proof of concept. 
* **Support**: I will also assume that you sent me any questions or concerns you have about this prompt before Monday, December 11th. Please let me know how I can support you and your work. 
* **Feedback**: Finally, I will assume you attended class in late November and early December to get feedback on your draft material. 

## Worksheet 4

Worksheet 4 will include the following prompt to help you get started on your proof of concept: 

"Describe the issue, context, audience, technique, and critical approach at play in your proof of concept for the final project in this course. Please include the media you're using to produce compelling content and also explain why this project matters to you. You are welcome to change this description before you submit your proof of concept in mid-December."

## Assessment 

I will use [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your proof of concept and your description of it. 

I will be generous in my assessment and reward proofs of concept that took risks and pushed the course material beyond what I taught and what we discussed in class.  

## What to Submit 

You should submit these two things for your final project: 

* Your content, which might be a video (say, 4-12 minutes), some audio (say, 4-12 minutes), a series of images (say, 5-30 of them), a technical or gameplay demo (say, 1-3 scenes of a game), or any of these accompanied by text (say, 150-500 words).
* A description of your content: ~250 words about the issue your proof of concept is addressing, its intended audience, and its context, technique, approach, and messaging. 

Please contact me before Monday, December 11th with any questions you have about the format of your content, including the file format. I'm happy to help. 

## When to Submit It 

Please use Brightspace to submit your final project (25% of your final mark) by noon (12pm) on Friday, December 15th. 

Important: I will deduct *ten points* from every submission I receive after 12pm on Friday, December 15th and *fifteen points* from every submission I receive after 12pm on Monday, December 18th. Given the time constraints for submitting marks, I need to receive your final project by the due date. Thank you for understanding. 

## List of Techniques 

Here is a list of techniques that may apply to this project and your proof of concept. The list is not exhaustive, meaning you're welcome to use a technique that isn't listed here. I will not assume you are familiar with everything below, and I also invite you to contact me if you want to learn more about any of these techniques or wish to suggest another one for the list. Curiosity is encouraged. Run some internet searches to see what some of these are all about! 

* acousmatics (hiding the source of a sound)
* adaptation (across formats or media)
* amplification through simplification (cartoon or caricature)
* annotation (describing or commenting on a work in its negative spaces)
* counterfactual (possible alternative to historical events)
* deepening (turning 3D to 2D)
* demake (produce for an older platform)
* détournement (creatively disfiguring something; see Situationism)
* event score (instructions for a happening; see Fluxus)
* environmental storytelling (using narrative architecture to prompt spatial stories)
* flattening (turning 3D to 2D)
* framing (using boundaries to include, exclude, or highlight aspects of media; cropping an image, e.g.)
* imitation (mimicry of style)
* infographic (a collection of graphs and data visualizations that communicate an overview of a topic)
* masking (cutting the audio or images to interpret and experience the work)
* mix (a sequence of musical tracks edited together into a continuous track)
* prototype (branching scenario or wireframe, e.g.; a working but incomplete version of a project)
* provenance tracing (following an object or labour practice to its origins or as close as you can get to them)
* reaction video (Let's Play or livestream, e.g.)
* recontextualization (fan fiction; filling in the gaps of media)
* simulation (a model for imitating a world or experience)
* storyboarding (a visual expression of how a story unfolds scene by scene or shot by shot)
* theatre of the imagination (drama that unfolds in the individual or collective imagination, typically in the absence of images and video; common in radio and tabletop gaming; also associated with "written cinema")
* values assessment (identifying the ideologies or beliefs that motivate the work at hand; e.g., what determines how the work distinguishes "signal" from "noise")
