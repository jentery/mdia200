# Final Project: Proof of Concept

The purpose of this assignment is for you to demonstrate what you've learned in this course by using media to produce compelling content about an issue or problem that's not only pertinent to Media Studies but also important to you, your community, or your academic work. 

## A Proof of Concept 

Given the time constraints of this course, not to mention the fact that it's a 200-level class, your response to this prompt should be only a "proof of concept." 

A proof of concept in Media Studies: 

* Demonstrates the feasibility of a project by creating and sharing a *part* of it for feedback prior to proceeding with all of it. 
* Tests an idea and shows people why it will work "at scale." 

Examples of proofs of concept include: 

* Demos, 
* Samples (from any point in the project),
* Wireframes, 
* Pilots (especially in television),
* Prototypes (usually rough ones), and
* Overviews or condensed versions of projects.

Nina Belojevic's project, [*Hyperlit*](https://ninabelojevic.wordpress.com/portfolio/hyperlit/), includes two proofs of concept: a series of wireframes and a video prototype. She describes the project like so: "HyperLit is a prototype that imagines a model for a social reading environment that encourages the deep attention required to read literature while also drawing critical attention to structures and habits generated in the digital economy." 

## Media You Should Use 

Your project may *not* be: 

* An academic essay, 
* Propaganda, or
* An advertisement. 

By "no academic essay," I mean your proof of concept doesn't need a thesis near the beginning, followed by observations and evidence supporting that thesis, to conclude with a gesture summarizing the argument. 

Your project may be: 

* A video (4-12 minutes).
* Audio (4-12 minutes).
* A series of images (5-30 of them).
* A technical or gameplay demo (1-3 scenes of a game).
* Text (750-1250 words) or any of the above accompanied by text (150-500 words).

The numbers in parentheses are guidelines intended to reduce your project's scope as well as the time and labour you spend on it. 

Your proof of concept should be accompanied by a concise description (~250 words) of the issue it's addressing, its intended audience, and its context, technique, and critical approach. This description may be the same description you submitted in response to [Worksheet 4](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet4.html), Prompt 6. 

See Appendix 1 and 2 for additional instructions and guidance. 

## Expectations 

Here are some expectations implied by this prompt: 

* **Time**: Once you've followed steps 1-9 above, I recommend spending 3-6 hours on your proof of concept.
* **Instructions**: I will assume you read this prompt and these instructions for the proof of concept. 
* **Support**: I will also assume that you sent me any questions or concerns you have about this prompt by Monday, December 11th. Please let me know how I can support you and your work. 
* **Feedback**: I will assume you attended class in late November to get feedback on draft material. 

## Assessment 

I will use [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your proof of concept and your description (~250 words) of it. 

Projects in the A- to A+ range must be clear and compelling with respect to their: 

* Issue (which may be personal but should also be social or cultural), 
* Relevance to Media Studies in general and to this course in particular, 
* Intended audience,
* Context, 
* Audience, 
* Technique (see Appendix 2 for examples), and 
* Critical approach (presumably drawn from this class). 

Of course, your proof of concept can "show" your awareness of these elements rather than "tell" your audience about them. You need not be "on the nose" about all or any of them. 

I will be generous in my assessment and reward proofs of concept that take risks and push the course material beyond expectations. 

Again, see Appendix 1 and 2 for additional instructions and guidance. 

## What to Submit 

You should submit these two things for your final project: 

* Your content, which might be a video (4-12 minutes), some audio (4-12 minutes), a series of images (5-30 of them), a technical or gameplay demo (1-3 scenes of a game), text (750-1250 words), or any the above accompanied by text (150-500 words).
* A description of your content: ~250 words about an issue your proof of concept is addressing, its intended audience, and its context, technique, and critical approach.

Please contact me prior to Monday, December 11th with any questions you have about the format of your content, including the file format. 

## When to Submit It 

Please use Brightspace to submit your final project (25% of your final mark) by noon (12pm) on Friday, December 15th. 

Important: I will deduct *ten points* from every submission I receive after noon on Friday, December 15th and *fifteen points* from every submission I receive after noon on Monday, December 18th. Given the time constraints for submitting marks, I need to receive your final project by the due date. Thank you for understanding.

## Appendix 1: Steps to Produce a Proof of Concept

You're welcome to follow these steps to produce your proof of concept: 

1. **Review**. Review what you learned in this course. 
2. **Interests**. Identify an area or two of the course material that interested you personally or academically (or both!). What, in short, is something you care about? 
3. **Issue or problem**. Connect those interests with an issue or problem pertinent to Media Studies. It could be something we discussed in class, but it doesn't have to be. Here are some examples that come to mind (obviously not an exhaustive list): 
   * The role of intersectionality or hegemony in content produced by marginalized people.
   * How to study the shared pulse of affect, including the ways media affect people's capacity to act. 
   * The role of habits or rituals (as opposed to the transmission of information) in the production of shared beliefs and community. 
   * The question of what, if anything, media "cause" or determine (e.g., violence). 
   * The ways the meaning of media is policed by fans, scholars, artists, and intermediaries. 
   * An issue not addressed by the course material that's nevertheless pertinent to Media Studies in the 21st century. 
4. **Source material**. Determine whether you're creating a primary or secondary source. "Primary Sources are immediate, first-hand accounts of a topic, from people who had a direct connection with it." "Secondary sources are one step removed from primary sources, though they often quote or otherwise use primary sources. They can cover the same topic, but add a layer of interpretation and analysis" (definitions care of [Healey Library at UMass](https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary)). You are welcome to engage [primary sources we studied in this course](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/#materials), but you are certainly not expected to do so. Your proof of concept simply needs to be relevant to Media Studies. 
5. **Context and audience**. Now situate your interests (Step 2) and issue or problem (Step 3) in a context with an audience. Your sense of context and audience should be as specific as possible to help you reduce your project's scope. Here are some examples of what I mean: 
   * Not "students" but "undergraduates in Media Studies 200 at UVic" or "students in the Society for Students with a Disability (SSD)."
   * Not "gamers" but "people active at r/gaymers." 
   * Not "tv fans" but "fans of science fiction horror and thrillers such as *Stranger Things*, *Kindred*, and *Returnal*."
6. **Media and mode of address**. Once you've a sense of audience and context, consider how you wish to address the issue or problem you identified. You can approach this step by privileging your audience and the context: which media or formats are popular among this group or expected in this situation? Or you can rely on what you know best and how you prefer to communicate: whether you're most comfortable with audio, image, video, or text, for instance. Do you want your audience to listen, read, watch, look, participate . . . ? Will you address them directly (the second-person "you")? Will you use first-person pronouns ("I" and "we")? 
7. **Technique**. Selecting a technique will render Steps 1-6 actionable. After all, it helps to have a method or procedure for turning this into that. We experimented with some techniques in class, and a longer (but not exhaustive) list is in Appendix 2. Review that appendix to see which techniques are familiar to you and which ones you might want to research for your project. To help you get started, here are a few grounded examples that point to proofs of concept for both primary and secondary source materials (I refer to primary sources from class to render these examples familiar to you; but again, your proof of concept does not have to address a primary source from class): 
    * Use imitation (technique) to mimic the style and composition of "Translated, From the Japanese" to tell your own story about relocating to Canada. This imitation would be a secondary source. 
    * Use a mix (technique) in a theatre or club setting to introduce animators to the music of Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries and their influences. This mix would likely be a secondary source. 
    * Use a reaction video (technique) to document the affective experience of playing *Hair Nah*. This reaction video would likely be a secondary source. 
    * Use a branching-scenario prototype (technique) to adapt the story of "Message in a Bottle" into a Twine or Bitsy game. This adaptation would likely be a primary source. 
    * Use annotation (technique) to decode the lighting and mise-en-scène of *Biidaaban*. This annotation would be a secondary source. 
    * Use acousmatics (technique) to interview Marina Kittaka about *Secrets Agent* for a podcast about vignette games. This interview would be a primary source. 
    * Use an event score (technique) to provide fans of *Within the Wires* with instructions to stage their own stories in the world of the Institute. This event score would likely be a secondary source. 
    * Use provenance tracing (technique) to describe the labour and materials required to make a game like *Umurangi Generation*. This tracing would likely be a secondary source. 
8. **Approach**. A technique is even more compelling when you articulate it with a critical approach. Select *one or two such approaches from the course material* that best describe your work in this proof of concept. You might find it easier to identify your approach first and then follow it with a technique, thus reversing the order of Steps 7 and 8 here. That's totally fine. Either way, here are some examples of articulating a technique (listed first) with approaches from class (listed second): 
    * Imitation: intermedia, media aesthetics, and/or semiotics 
    * Mix: shared pulse of affect, cultivation theory, uses and gratification, and/or agenda-setting 
    * Reaction video: mimetic communication, reflective model of culture, and/or ritual view of culture 
    * Branching-scenario prototype: narrative, media convergence, and/or uses and gratification  
    * Annotation: semiotics and/or two-step flow 
    * Acousmatics: impressions management, transmission model of communication, and/or dramaturgy
    * Event score: intermedia, social learning, dramaturgy, environmental storytelling, and/or ritual view of culture 
    * Provenance tracing: economy of media and/or naturalization model of culture 
9. **Messaging**. We're almost there. Before you start producing content, describe how your proof of concept will communicate a message. First, what's the message? Can you state it in a sentence or two? Second, place your messaging on a spectrum from implicit to explicit or indirect to direct. How subtle or forward is it? Finally, to what degree are *you* ("your voice") communicating the message, and to what degree are *your media* doing so? Recall how media are material agents. This means they package or automate aspects of communication but also have material or physical connotations. Consider, for instance, how stop-motion animations like *Biidaaban* may use indexical signs to connote depth and tactile experience while text animations like *THE M00D* may use symbols to connote flatness and fleeting experience. 
10. **Get cooking**. Start working on your proof of concept and seek feedback along the way. Note that you'll have time during class in late November to work on your proof of concept and workshop it with peers. 

## Appendix 2: List of Techniques 

Here is a list of techniques that may be applicable to this project. The list is not exhaustive, meaning you're welcome to use a technique that isn't listed here. I will not assume you are familiar with everything below, and I invite you to contact me if you want to learn more about any of these techniques or wish to suggest another one for the list. Curiosity is encouraged. Run some internet searches to see what some of these techniques are all about! 

* acousmatics (hiding the source of a sound)
* adaptation (stories expressed across formats, media, and time + space)
* amplification through simplification (cartoon or caricature)
* annotation (describing or commenting on a work in its negative spaces)
* counterfactual (possible alternative to historical events)
* deepening (turning 3D to 2D)
* demake (produce content on an older platform)
* détournement (creatively "disfiguring" something; see Situationism)
* event score (instructions for a happening; see Fluxus)
* environmental storytelling (using narrative architecture to prompt the construction of spatial stories)
* flattening (turning 3D to 2D)
* framing (using boundaries to include, exclude, or highlight aspects of media; cropping an image, e.g.)
* imitation (mimicry of style)
* infographics (collection of graphs and data visualizations that communicate an overview of a topic)
* masking (cutting the audio or images of content)
* mix (a sequence of musical tracks edited together into a continuous track)
* prototype (a preliminary sample or model of something)
* provenance tracing (following an object or labour practice to its origins)
* reaction video (Let's Play or livestream, e.g.)
* recontextualization (fan fiction that creates backstories for established characters, e.g.)
* simulation (a model for imitating a world or experience)
* storyboarding (a visual expression of how a story unfolds scene by scene or shot by shot)
* theatre of the imagination (drama or "written cinema" that unfolds in the individual or collective imagination, typically in the absence of images and video)
* values assessment (identifying the ideologies or beliefs that motivate the production of content; e.g., the values that determine how a work distinguishes "signal" from "noise")
