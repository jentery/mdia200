# Worksheet 4

This is your last worksheet in MDIA 200!!! It covers material from Weeks 10 and 12 (Nov. 9, 20, and 23) of class. Your response is due via Brightspace by Friday, December 1st at noon.  

The worksheet is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use your notes, assigned primary sources, the course website, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

*Please ensure you cite your source material.* 

## Download the Worksheet 

Please [download the worksheet](mdia200Worksheet4.docx) (DOCX format) to complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac.  

If you need the worksheet in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the worksheet does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* completing the worksheet. 

## Format

This open-book worksheet contains *six* short-answer prompts, totaling 100 points. Responses to prompts in Section 1 are each worth 15 points, and responses to prompts in Section 2 are each worth 20 points. 

## Academic Integrity 

By responding to this worksheet, you confirm that: 

* You followed UVic academic regulations and observed standards of academic integrity (e.g., no plagiarism or cheating). 
* You completed this worksheet individually.
* Each response to every prompt is your own, excluding quoted and paraphrased material that is clearly cited. 
* You cited any sources, including assigned course material and internet sources, that you used to address the prompts. 

## Section 1 (15 points each)

Please use no more than *225 words* per response. Do not include audio, images, or video in your responses. Your examples should be specific, citable, and drawn from course material between Weeks 1 and 12. By "course material," I mean assigned primary sources, lectures, class discussions, and the course website, including the notes and glossary. You are welcome and in fact encouraged to quote definitions in your responses, but please cite your sources, including the course website (see "Citing Your Sources" below for details). 

1. What is neoliberalism? Use an example from the course material to explain its importance.  
2. What is the culture industry, and what is the content industry? Explain their importance and how they differ from each other. 
3. Describe *Umurangi Generation*'s approach to the economy of media and explain why that approach is important. 
4. What's the most important thing you learned in this course? Please be as precise as possible. (I will assess the precision of your response and not your opinion about the most important thing you learned.)

## Section 2 (20 points each)

Please use no more than *300 words* per response. You are welcome to embed or attach audio, images, and video files as examples of content "outside the course material." These files may be your own, but please cite them if they are not. By "course material," I mean assigned primary sources, lectures, class discussions, and the course website, including the notes and glossary. Again, please cite your sources, including the course website (see "Citing Your Sources" below for details).

<ol start=5>
<li>Use <em>one</em> example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly address where there's a lack of diversity in media. Then use <em>one</em> more example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly demonstrate the role media play in social or cultural change.</li>
<li>Describe the issue, context, audience, technique, and critical approach at work in your proof of concept for the <a href="https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/final.html">final project</a> in this course. Please mention the media you're using to produce your content and explain why the project matters to you. You are welcome to change this description before you submit your proof of concept in mid-December.</li>
</ol>
  
## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess each of your responses in Sections 1 and 2. 

* 14-15 points (Section 1) and 18-20 points (Section 2): the response is compelling, and it enriches or enhances the course material (exceeds all expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive ("original insight")
* 12-13 points (Section 1) and 16-17 points (Section 2): the response is compelling and corresponds with the course material (exceeds some or most expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 11 points (Section 1) and 14-15 points (Section 2): the response corresponds with the course material (meets expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, and occasionally convincing 
* 9-10 points (Section 1) and 12-13 points (Section 2:) the response corresponds with some of the course material (meets some expectations); the use of an example warrants some clarification  
* 1-8 points (Section 1) and 1-11 points (Section 2): the response does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material and/or there's no example
* 0 points: no response  

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

10 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no works cited page is included at the end of the worksheet (see details below).

The total of these points (0-100) will constitute 15% of your final mark in this course. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each response to earn a high mark.* 

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw examples and definitions. Here are MLA reference entries for the course site and the primary sources for Weeks 10 and 12 (just be sure to change the access date to correspond with your date of access): 

* Origame Digital and Naphtali Faulkner. *Umurangi Generation*, 2020, umurangigeneration.com. Accessed 10 November 2023.
