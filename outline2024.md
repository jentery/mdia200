# Guide to Media Studies (Draft)

This document is an outline for a guide I'm creating to introduce undergraduate student at UVic to the field and practice of Media Studies. Please note that, at UVic, [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/index.php) is a certificate program that sits alongside, but is distinct from, our programs in Film Studies, Professional Communication, Technology and Society, Academic and Technical Writing, and Professional Writing in Journalism and Publishing.

## Defining Media 

- a material agent for transforming this into that 
- congealed labour 
- "in the middle" 
- the mediation of communication
- the spiritual medium (when people were media)
- the messenger (when people were media) 
- the process of making, recording, storing, and circulating (reproduction)
- differences between media and the media

## Forms of Communication 

- intrapersonal 
- interpersonal 
- organizational
- mass 
- mimetic
- ritual
- miscommunication 

## Values of Communication 

- anti-racist communication
- intersectionality 
- Indigenization and decolonization 
- inclusion and universal design
- critical media practice

## Types of Media 

These five media are the focus of this introduction to Media Studies. 

- audio
- images
- text
- video 
- action 

You might prefer to use "mechanics" or even "interface" instead of "action." Also note the difference between film and video as well as text and type or font. Here, "text" is not a "methodological field" (where a classroom, novel, advertisement, or wrestling match could be a text) but rather a medium. 

## Media Formats 

Note: many people also consider these formats to be "media," and that's fine. Consider, for instance, the treatment of books, comics, video games, and television as media in book history, comics studies, game studies, and television studies, respectively. It's still useful in each case to ask how these objects of inquiry engage the media of audio, images, text, video, and action, and the definition of "media" or "medium" is shaped by the field or discipline of study. 

- advertisement
- animation
- book
- comics 
- essay (including video essays)
- file formats (MP3, JPG, PDF, e.g.)
- livestream
- podcast
- tabletop game 
- television 
- video game 

## Critical Media Practice 

- tips for making compelling content with values in mind
- attention to community, reciprocity, and equity

## Approaches to Media 

- media and information (transmission and management)
- media industries 
- the uses and effects of media 
- media and persuasion (rhetoric)
- media and meaning (semiotics)
- media and narrative 
- media and representation (including identity)
- media and culture (including shared beliefs)
- media and affect 
- media and art (including specificity and milieu)
- media preservation
