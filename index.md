# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

The fact that we're gathering here to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I am still learning about the past and present of such injustices, and I will make no assumptions about you or your knowledge of these lands. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too. 

# Calendar Description

"Surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." See [MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses).

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/) certificate. 

# Learning Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, and video across criticism and production today. 
2. Learn a variety of methods for engaging media. This means we'll not only discuss but also practice different approaches to examining and experiencing audio, images, text, and video in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made and interpreted. 
4. Respond regularly to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning in Media Studies.  
5. Produce your own compelling content by applying a particular approach to media you learned this term. This application will be your final project. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production today. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional practices related to media. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. I spend 13.78% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. Now I teach courses for UVic Media Studies, English, and Professional Communication, and I'm the acting director of Media Studies. Academics aside, I enjoy playing TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer, and I spent a chunk of my summer camping and hiking with my family. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. 

# Materials 

You do not need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including Brightspace), and a camera. Most of the primary sources are online. I will provide you with PDF copies of them if they aren't. 

During the course, we'll study the following (in this order): 

* The Flash animation, [*THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries
* The browser game, [*Secrets Agent*](https://even-kei.itch.io/secrets-agent) (2014), by Marina Kittaka 
* The dramatic podcast, [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), by  Janina Matthewson, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, and Night Vale
* The browser game, [*Hair Nah*](https://www.momopixel.com/hair-nah) (2017), by Momo Pixel
* The comic, ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/killing-and-dying/) (2015), by Adrian Tomine  
* The stop-motion animation, [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.spottedfawnproductions.com/biidaaban/) (2018), by Amanda Strong, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, and Bracken Hanuse Corlett

* The video essay, ["Completionism, 'Good' Endings, and the Detective Genre in *NORCO*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZhCF1zBDoo) (2023), by Asia Tyson 

We will also talk about Hwang Dong-hyuk's *Squid Game* (2021), but I am not assigning it for you to watch. We'll discuss Angela Haupt's ["You Don’t Like Violence But Want to Watch *Squid Game.* These Tips Can Help"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/10/14/tv-violence-squid-game-watch/) (2021) instead. 

I am providing you with a [glossary](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/glossary.html) of key terms as well as [my notes](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/notes.html) for each week. I encourage you to consult both documents regularly.  

I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate weekly announcements (usually on Thursday or Friday) to help you plan for what's coming next,  
* Provide you with copies of some assigned materials, 
* Point you to other assigned materials available online, 
* Accept all your assignments, including your four worksheets and final project (please don't submit anything to me by email),  
* Comment on those assignments, and  
* Mark those assignments according to rubrics I'll provide.    

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional.

# Assignments

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term (note that there are no exams, quizzes, presentations, or participation marks in this course): 

1. **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 2 and 3 (due by Friday, September 29th at noon)
2. **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 4, 5, and 6 (due by Friday, October 20th at noon)
3. **[Worksheet 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet3.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 7, 8, and 9 (due by Friday, November 10th at noon)
4. **[Worksheet 4](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet4.html)**: 15% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 10 and 12 (due by Friday, December 1st at noon)
5. **[Final Project](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/final.html)**: 25% of your final grade (due Friday, December 15th at noon) 

*Worksheets*: Each worksheet will ask you to define key terms in media studies, briefly analyze some primary sources (from class activities and lectures), share your responses to weekly exercises, and apply your learning. I will distribute each worksheet about three or four weeks before it's due. A worksheet will never contain more than ten prompts / questions, and I will encourage you to use class time to draft your responses to those prompts / questions. 

*Final Project*: You'll conclude the course by producing your own compelling content. You'll apply one approach you learned this term to your own media work or interests, be they academic, occupational, or personal. You'll have the opportunity to compose audio, images, text, and/or video for this assignment, and I'll give you options for responding. I will distribute the prompt for the Final Project on Monday, October 30th. 

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace (rather than email) to submit all your work. You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace; however, you'll need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer.  

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on each assignment according to its rubric. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss any feedback I provide. Please also note that I'm teaching two courses this term (my other class has 23 students in it) while parenting, conducting research, and directing UVic's Media Studies program. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut material. I've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 5 hours of study and practice* to MDIA 200 each week, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (MTh). Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

I will give you time during class to draft some responses to prompts / questions in your worksheets; however, you will need more time (between classes) to develop and refine your work, hence the recommended 3 to 5 hours per week.  

# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the term. It's subject to change. In fact, I'm 98.37% certain there will be changes. I will use a Brightspace announcement to notify you at least two weeks in advance of those changes, and I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload (e.g., add an assignment or reading).

### Prerequisites 

Academic Writing Requirement satisfied. This course counts toward UVic's Media Studies certificate. 
  
### Assessment and Feedback

Two of the four Worksheets as well as the Final Project are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these three assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use UVic's [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to produce rubrics to assess your work.

I respond to email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 

### Learning Climate  

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. We are expected to adhere to [UVic's equity and human rights policies](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/) and the [Trifaculty Code of Professional Behaviour](https://www.uvic.ca/services/advising/assets/docs/tri-fac-student-code-of-conduct.pdf). You should alert me immediately if you have any questions about these policies and their application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 

I aim to create an inclusive learning environment that attends to difference and honours each of you, including your experiences as well as the intersections of race, gender, disability, sexuality, religion, power, and class. I want to be a resource for you, and I am still learning. If something is said in class (by anyone, including me) that makes you feel uncomfortable, then don't hesitate to talk with me. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your university records, then let me know and I'll correct the documents provided to me. If your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside of class, then keep me posted and we'll make adjustments. I also welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the course and/or its culture and materials, and I will make available mechanisms for anonymous feedback since you may prefer them.

The following student groups may be relevant to your life as a student here at UVic: 

* [The Native Students Union](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/home) "is an organization run for and by Indigenous students at UVic. Since circa 1969, Indigenous students have been coming together to form community, support each other, advocate for Indigenous rights and wellbeing, and just exist together at the institution. The NSU runs events and programs, manages a student space with services, and advocates for Indigenous student success and wellness at UVic. The NSU Council leads the NSU in running and developing these services." 
* [The Students of Colour Collective](https://soccollective.com/) "are a Collective of self-identified people of colour at the University of Victoria. Anyone identifying as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and Person of Colour) is welcome to use our lounge and access our resources. SOCC exists to create space that fosters community building, and facilitates networking and gatherings for self-identified BIPOC folks. Our work centres on art, awareness, education, action, advocacy, and support. Every student of colour is welcome to get in touch and find out how to get involved."
* [The Society for Students with a Disability (SSD)](https://uvicssd.ca/) "is a post-secondary student advocacy group under the University of Victoria Students’ Union which promotes the full participation and inclusion of students who self-identify as having one or more disabilities at the University of Victoria. The SSD aims to support students who self-identify as having one or more disabilities; in particular, we support students to reduce barriers in the social, emotional, and educational domains of student life."
* [The Gender Empowerment Centre (GEM)](https://genderempowermentcentre.ca/) "is an inclusive space, focused on the needs of self-identified women, non-binary, trans and gender non-conforming folks to organize, network, access resources, attend workshops and events, study, and relax. Our space is open to both University of Victoria students and community members."
* [UVic Pride](https://www.prideuvic.com/) "is an organization for all people who are queer, queer-positive, gender-variant and/or intersex. We strive to meet the needs of people who self-identify as queer (including but not limited to people who identify as Two Spirit, bisexual, lesbian, gay, asexual, demisexual, aromantic, and pansexual, as well as people who do not identify with these labels); trans people; those who are questioning their sexuality or gender; those who are struggling with concerns related to intersexuality; and supportive partners, friends, family members, and allies."

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any supports to succeed. I'll do my best to help. If, for instance, you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) full of resources. They offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation, confidential assessment, and counselling services (individual and small group). Many of these programs are connected with Health Services, which you may contact by phone. 

The [Student Services website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/departments/student-services/index.php) lists several policies, knowledge of which may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this course, but they're still important.
