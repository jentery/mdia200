# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

The fact that we're gathering here to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I am still learning about the past and present of such injustices, and I will make no assumptions about you or your knowledge of these lands. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too. 

# Calendar Description

"Surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." See [MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses).

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/) certificate. 

# Learning Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, and video across criticism and production today. 
2. Learn a variety of methods for engaging media. This means we'll not only discuss but also practice different approaches to examining and experiencing audio, images, text, and video in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made and interpreted. 
4. Respond regularly to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning in Media Studies.  
5. Produce your own compelling content by applying a particular approach to media you learned this term. This application will be your final project. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production today. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional practices related to media. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. I spend 13.78% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. Now I teach courses for UVic Media Studies, English, and Professional Communication, and I'm the acting director of Media Studies. Academics aside, I enjoy playing TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer, and I spent a chunk of my summer camping and hiking with my family. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. 

# Materials 

You do not need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including Brightspace), and a camera. Most of the primary sources are online. I will provide you with PDF copies of them if they aren't. 

During the course, we'll study the following (in this order): 

* The Flash animation, [*THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries

We will also talk about Hwang Dong-hyuk's *Squid Game* (2021), but I am not assigning it for you to watch. We'll discuss Angela Haupt's ["You Don’t Like Violence But Want to Watch *Squid Game.* These Tips Can Help"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/10/14/tv-violence-squid-game-watch/) (2021) instead. 

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional.

I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate weekly announcements (usually on Thursday or Friday) to help you plan for what's coming next,  
* Provide you with copies of some assigned materials, 
* Point you to other assigned materials available online, 
* Accept all your assignments, including your four worksheets and your final project (please don't submit anything to me by email),  
* Comment on those assignments, and  
* Mark those assignments according to rubrics I'll provide.
