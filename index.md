# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

The fact that we're gathering here to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I am still learning about the past and present of such injustices, and I will make no assumptions about you or your knowledge of these lands. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too. 

# Calendar Description

"Surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." See [MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses).

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/) certificate. 

# Learning Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, and video across criticism and production today. 
2. Learn a variety of methods for engaging media. This means we'll not only discuss but also practice different approaches to examining and experiencing audio, images, text, and video in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made and interpreted. 
4. Respond regularly to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning in Media Studies.  
5. Produce your own compelling content by applying a particular approach to media you learned this term. This application will be your final project. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production today. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional practices related to media. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. I spend 13.78% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. Now I teach courses for UVic Media Studies, English, and Professional Communication, and I'm the acting director of Media Studies. Academics aside, I enjoy playing TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer, and I spent a chunk of my summer camping and hiking with my family. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. 

# Materials 

You do not need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including Brightspace), and a camera. Most of the primary sources are online. I will provide you with PDF copies of them if they aren't. 

During the course, we'll study the following (in this order): 

* The Flash animation, [*THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries
* The browser game, [*Secrets Agent*](https://even-kei.itch.io/secrets-agent) (2014), by Marina Kittaka 
* The dramatic podcast, [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), by  Janina Matthewson, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, and Night Vale
* The browser game, [*Hair Nah*](https://www.momopixel.com/hair-nah) (2017), by Momo Pixel
* The comic, ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/killing-and-dying/) (2015), by Adrian Tomine  
* The stop-motion animation, [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.spottedfawnproductions.com/biidaaban/) (2018), by Amanda Strong, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, and Bracken Hanuse Corlett

* The video essay, ["Completionism, 'Good' Endings, and the Detective Genre in *NORCO*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZhCF1zBDoo) (2023), by Asia Tyson 

We will also talk about Hwang Dong-hyuk's *Squid Game* (2021), but I am not assigning it for you to watch. We'll discuss Angela Haupt's ["You Don’t Like Violence But Want to Watch *Squid Game.* These Tips Can Help"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/10/14/tv-violence-squid-game-watch/) (2021) instead. 

I am providing you with a [glossary](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/glossary.html) of terms mentioned during lectures and discussions. I will update this glossary for every lecture and encourage you to consult it weekly.  

I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate weekly announcements (usually on Thursday or Friday) to help you plan for what's coming next,  
* Provide you with copies of some assigned materials, 
* Point you to other assigned materials available online, 
* Accept all your assignments, including your four worksheets and final project (please don't submit anything to me by email),  
* Comment on those assignments, and  
* Mark those assignments according to rubrics I'll provide.    

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional.

# Assignments

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term (note that there are no exams, quizzes, presentations, or participation marks in this course): 

1. **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 2 and 3 (due by Friday, September 29th at noon)
2. **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 4, 5, and 6 (due by Friday, October 20th at noon)
3. **[Worksheet 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet3.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 7, 8, and 9 (due by Friday, November 10th at noon)
4. **[Worksheet 4](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/worksheet4.html)**: 15% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 10 and 12 (due by Friday, December 1st at noon)
5. **[Final Project](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200/final.html)**: 25% of your final grade (due Friday, December 15th at noon) 

*Worksheets*: Each worksheet will ask you to define key terms in media studies, briefly analyze some primary sources (from class activities and lectures), share your responses to weekly exercises, and apply your learning. I will distribute each worksheet about three or four weeks before it's due. A worksheet will never contain more than ten prompts / questions, and I will encourage you to use class time to draft your responses to those prompts / questions. 

*Final Project*: You'll conclude the course by producing your own compelling content. You'll apply one approach you learned this term to your own media work or interests, be they academic, occupational, or personal. You'll have the opportunity to compose audio, images, text, and/or video for this assignment, and I'll give you options for responding. I will distribute the prompt for the Final Project on Monday, October 30th. 

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace (rather than email) to submit all your work. You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace; however, you'll need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer.  

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on each assignment according to its rubric. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss any feedback I provide. Please also note that I'm teaching two courses this term (my other class has 23 students in it) while parenting, conducting research, and directing UVic's Media Studies program. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut material. I've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 5 hours of study and practice* to MDIA 200 each week, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (MTh). Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

I will give you time during class to draft some responses to prompts / questions in your worksheets; however, you will need more time (between classes) to develop and refine your work, hence the recommended 3 to 5 hours per week.
