# Worksheet 2

This is your second of four worksheets in MDIA 200, and it covers material from Weeks 4, 5, and 6 (Sept. 25 - Oct. 12) of class. Your response is due via Brightspace by the end of Week 7: Friday, October 20th at noon.

The worksheet is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use your notes, assigned primary sources, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

## Download the Worksheet 

Please [download the worksheet](mdia200Worksheet2.docx) (DOCX format) to complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac. You are also welcome to copy the prompts and paste them into a word processor to address them. I do not recommend this approach because it's riskier than simply downloading the worksheet. If you nevertheless decide to copy and paste the prompts, then please ensure you include the Academic Integrity statement and a list of works cited (see below) in your response to the worksheet. 

If you need the worksheet in a format other than DOCX, then please let me know ASAP, and I'll make it happen ASAP. 

Note that the downloadable copy of the worksheet does *not* contain all the information on this page, which you should read *before* completing the worksheet. 

## Format

This open-book worksheet contains ten short-answer prompts, totaling 100 points. Responses to prompts in Section 1 are each worth 7 points, and responses to prompts in Section 2 are each worth 12 points. 

## Academic Integrity 

By responding to this worksheet, you confirm that: 

* You followed UVic academic regulations and observed standards of academic integrity (e.g., no plagiarism or cheating). 
* You completed this worksheet individually.
* Each response to every prompt is your own, excluding quoted and paraphrased material that is clearly cited. 
* You cited any sources, including assigned course material and internet sources, that you used to address the prompts. 

## Section 1 (7 points each)

Please do not use more than *175 words* per response. (I will use a word-counting tool during assessment.) Do not include audio, images, or video in your responses. Your examples should be drawn from course material in Weeks 4, 5, and 6. By "course material," I mean assigned primary sources, lectures, class discussions, and the course website, including the notes and glossary. You are welcome and in fact encouraged to quote definitions in your responses, but please cite your sources, including the course website (see "Citing Your Sources" below for details). 

1. Define the "ritual view of communication" and then explain its importance using *one* example from *Hair Nah*.
2. Define "optical image" and "perceptual image" in the context of comics and then explain their importance using *one* example from "Translated, From the Japanese." 
3. Define "intermedia" and then explain its importance using *one* example from the course material.
4. Define "*mise en scène*" and "lighting connotation" in animation and then explain their importance using *one* example from *Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*.

## Section 2 (12 points each)

Please do not use more than *225 words* per response. (I will use a word-counting tool during assessment.) You are welcome to embed or attach audio, images, and video files as examples of content "outside the course material." These files may be your own, but please cite them if they are not. By "course material," I mean assigned primary sources, lectures, class discussions, and the course website, including the notes and glossary. Again, please cite your sources, including the course website (see "Citing Your Sources" below for details).

<ol start=5>
<li>Use <em>one</em> example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly explain the tensions between media effects research and cultural studies of media.</li>
<li>During Week 4, I asked you to annotate "Translated, From the Japanese" to describe how the comic constructs life in Japan, the United States, or the air (on a plane). Please use those annotations to explain, in your own words, how the comic communicates the experience of "learning to look." You are welcome to annotate the comic on your own if you missed class that day.</li>
<li>Use <em>one</em> example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly explain <em>two</em> differences between medium specificity and media convergence.</li>
<li>During Week 6, I asked you to study <em>Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)</em> by masking the images and then cutting the sound. Please use the results of that exercise to explain, in your own words, Strong and Simpson's approach to media aesthetics. You are welcome to perform the exercise on your own if you missed class that day.</li>
<li>Use <em>one</em> example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly explain a situation when media are milieus for social and sensory experiences that blur the boundaries between art and technology.</li>
<li>Use <em>one</em> example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly explain the role media play in "mirroring" or capturing aspects of the real world for audiences around the world to access. Then use <em>one</em> more example <em>outside</em> the course material to briefly describe the role media play in creating a world for audiences to inhabit or imagine.</li>
</ol>
  
## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess each of your responses in Sections 1 and 2. 

* 7 points (Section 1) and 11-12 points (Section 2): the response is compelling, and it enriches or enhances the course material (exceeds all expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive ("original insight")
* 6 points (Section 1) and 10 points (Section 2): the response is compelling and corresponds with the course material (exceeds some or most expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 5 points (Section 1) and 9 points (Section 2): the response corresponds with the course material (meets expectations); the use of an example is clear, focused, and occasionally convincing 
* 4 points (Section 1) and 7-8 points (Section 2:) the response corresponds with some of the course material (meets some expectations); the use of an example warrants some clarification  
* 1-3 points (Section 1) and 1-6 points (Section 2): the response does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material and/or there's no example
* 0 points: no response  

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

10 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no works cited page is included at the end of the worksheet (see details below).

The total of these points (0-100) will constitute 20% of your final mark in this course. 

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw examples and definitions. Here are MLA reference entries for the course site and the primary sources for Weeks 4, 5, and 6 (just be sure to change the access date to correspond with your date of access):
