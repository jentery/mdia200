## Week 8 (Oct. 23 and 26): Media and Meaning

This week, media are not only material agents; they either consist of *signs* organized according to codes or become *difference engines* in the play of discourse. A sign may be reductive, or it may invite many possible meanings. Perhaps the messenger is literal, or maybe they're a poet or trickster. Meanings may persist, overlap, or contradict each other, and&#8212;most interesting&#8212;they are frequently unintended. Consider those moments when someone asserts, "I didn't mean to say that!" While noise in the transmission model may lack semantic value, unintended communications can be semantically rich. We'll see what kind of surprises arise in our conversations about media and meaning this week. 

*Questions for this week*: Must we mean what we communicate in writing? In speech? What strikes you as uncertain or unpredictable in the practice of media, and how do you take responsibility for what you didn't intend in your media work? Is it possible to make meaning without a code? 

*Primary source for the week*: Nalo Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle" (PDF; [2004](https://pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=425)), "a radical new twist on the time travel tale that demolishes the sentimental myth of childhood innocence." Content warning: racism; sexism; ableism; settler colonialism; gaslighting; sexual content, including strong language. 

*Format for the week*: short fiction (published in a paperback and e-book collection)

*Technique for the week*: theatre of the imagination. COMPLETE.

*Approaches addressed this week*: semiotics (icon, symbol, and index as well as types of codes); discourse; social order 

## Week 9 (Oct. 30 and Nov. 2): Media and Narrative

This week, media are not only material agents but also *patterns* in how stories and experiences are transformed by narratives. Media play significant roles in the construction of heroes and villains, arcs and perspectives, plots and subplots, quests and conflicts. Today, a common question is whether a narrative is interactive, nonlinear, or branching. Can you choose your own adventure? How many endings are there? The popular perception that digital media are inherently interactive helps to explain these questions, yet so, too, do people's desires for participation in storytelling and even genre. This week, we'll review some narratives and genres we've encountered this term and then shift our attention to how narratives emerge, or are crafted, from everyday activities, particularly the activity of play. 

*Questions for this week*: How do genres shape your expectations of media or your media habits? What's your preferred format for narrative content? When and why do media brush against the desire or impulse for narrative? What's a narrative that surprised you in some way? 

*Primary source for the week*: Niantic's [*Pokémon GO*](https://pokemongolive.com/) (2016), which "uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual creatures, called Pokémon, [who] appear as if they are in the player's real-world location." Content warning: bug-, snake- and spider-like Pokémon.

*Format for the week*: mobile game (augmented reality)

*Technique for the week*: storyboarding. Use text and images to transform the experience of playing *Pokémon GO* into a narrative of your choice. The narrative should consist of at least three scenes. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: environmental storytelling (especially emergent storytelling); narratology (especially narrative transformation); genre studies (especially genre as a social activity); ludology (especially ludonarrative dissonance)

## Week 10 (Nov. 6 and 9): The Economy of Media

This week, media are not only material agents but also *mechanisms* for reproducing content, amplifying it, tracking attention to it, and generating revenue from it. Content does not need to communicate a message in this model; it simply needs to circulate. Understanding this economy of media, including global media revenue, helps us to better understand the material conditions and labour of communication today, including phenomena like resource extraction, content farms and content moderation, crowdsourcing and distributed workforces, gamblification, and gig work. This week, we'll talk about the culture and content industries, who owns media and media infrastructures, if and when media are regulated, and what it means to produce content in the 2020s. 

*Questions for this week*: When are media a distraction? How is mediation also labour? How do you distinguish between entertainment and news in your everyday life? And what does "content capital" mean to you and your communities? 

*Primary source for the week*: Origame Digital and Naphtali Faulkner's [*Umurangi Generation*](https://www.umurangigeneration.com/) (2020), "a first person photography game in the shitty future. Set in Tauranga Aotearoa off the back of an impending crisis you are a courier for the Tauranga Express." Content warning: catastrophe; themes addressing the structural effects and lived experiences of colonialism, capitalism, fascism, and climate change.

*Format for the week*: simulation (video game made for consoles using Unity)

*Technique for the week*: tracing. Research *Umurangi Generation* to describe&#8212;to the best of your knowledge&#8212;the labour, materials, and institutions involved in making it. Attribute the labour where possible and also note what you can't determine or trace. 

Approaches addressed this week: political economy; neoliberalism; vertical and horizontal integration; labour studies; infrastructure studies; ownership effects (public, private, corporate, and indie); media regulation; the culture industry; the content industry; fandom and participatory culture
