## Week 3 (Sept. 18 and 21): Media and Mass Communication

This week, media are not only material agents but also *channels* for transmitting messages or *vehicles* for encoding and decoding them. Sender-receiver and one-to-many dynamics are common in the organizational and mass communication paradigms. Investments in information, encryption, and matters of scale are common, too. We'll talk about these paradigms in the contexts of mass media, globalization, and media proliferation. 

*Questions for this week*: Do you think messages can be isolated or extracted from media? From their contexts? When and why might you ask, "Can you hear me?" or "Did you get my message?" And when and why might you declare, "There will be no more communication"? 

*Primary source for the week*: [Season 1, Cassette 1](https://beta.prx.org/stories/232303) of Janina Matthewson, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, and Nightvale's [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), which "takes the form of an audio course in full body relaxation issued by The Institute to you, (the listener) a nameless medical inmate. Is the narrator relaying something more than just relaxation techniques? As listeners move through the relaxation curriculum a deeper and more personal story unravels." Content warning: bugs (including bug abuse), gaslighting, stalking, medical setting, and themes related to mental health and pathologization

*Format for the week*: podcast (anthology)

*Technique for the week*: recontextualization. Develop the backstory for Oleta or Hester in *Within the Wires* to further explain why she performs the role of sender or receiver in the story's one-to-one and one-to-many communications. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: the mathematical model of communication (transmission), the social model of communication (encoding-decoding), two-step flow, convergence
