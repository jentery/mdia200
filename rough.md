## Week 3 (Sept. 18 and 21): Media and Mass Communication

This week, media are not only material agents but also *channels* for transmitting messages or *vehicles* for encoding and decoding them. Sender-receiver and one-to-many dynamics are common in the organizational and mass communication paradigms. Investments in information, encryption, and matters of scale are common, too. We'll talk about these paradigms in the contexts of mass media, globalization, and media proliferation. 

*Questions for this week*: Do you think messages can be isolated or extracted from media? From their contexts? When and why might you ask, "Can you hear me?" or "Did you get my message?" And when and why might you declare, "There will be no more communication"? 

*Primary source for the week*: [Season 1, Cassette 1](https://beta.prx.org/stories/232303) of Janina Matthewson, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, and Nightvale's [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), which "takes the form of an audio course in full body relaxation issued by The Institute to you, (the listener) a nameless medical inmate. Is the narrator relaying something more than just relaxation techniques? As listeners move through the relaxation curriculum a deeper and more personal story unravels." Content warning: bugs (including bug abuse), gaslighting, stalking, medical setting, and themes related to mental health and pathologization

*Format for the week*: podcast (anthology)

*Technique for the week*: recontextualization. Develop the backstory for Oleta or Hester in *Within the Wires* to further explain why she performs the role of sender or receiver in the story's one-to-one and one-to-many communications. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: the mathematical model of communication (transmission), the social model of communication (encoding-decoding), two-step flow, convergence

## Week 4 (Sept. 25 and 28): Media and Communication as Culture

This week, media are not only material agents but also *practices* that reproduce the communication habits and values of a *community* or *worldview*. Think of cosplay or Reddit communities, for example, alongside phrases like "indie culture," "the culture of Hollywood," "queer culture," and "gamer culture." Culture is, in this sense, a way of living as well as the content or "canon" associated with it. We'll talk about media and power as well as how cultural approaches offer alternatives to "media effects" paradigms and transmission models of communication. 

*Questions for this week*: Why are media so often associated with popular culture? Do you think people tend to passively, actively, or selectively engage media? How are media entwined with how we learn to look, watch, listen, and play? How are the expressions or demonstrations of power and resistance? 

*Primary sources for the week*: 1) Momo Pixel's [*Hair Nah*](https://www.momopixel.com/hair-nah) (2017), "a travel game about a black woman who is tired of people touching her hair." Content warning: "micro-aggression of assumed authority and ownership of black bodies." 2) Adrian Tomine's ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/killing-and-dying/) (2015), "a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images." Content warning: conflict between parents, bad dad, and themes of assimilation and leaving home.

*Format for the week*: comic (in a graphic novel)

*Technique for the week*: annotation. Use the margins and gutters of "Translated, from the Japanese" to describe how it uses symbols and gestures to communicate the realities of Japan, the United States, and travel between them. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: media effects (direct, minimal, and third-person); uses and gratification model; social cognitive theory (especially representational modelling); cultivation effects (especially enculturation and mainstreaming); agenda setting; the ritual view of communication; representation (especially absence and stereotypes); institutions and hegemony (including dominant, negotiated, and oppositional readings); the gaze; framing; critical race theory; critical disability theory; queer theory; de-, post-, and anti-colonial theory; intersectional feminism; textual analysis
