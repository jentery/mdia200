## Week 10 (Nov. 6 and 9): The Economy of Media

This week, media are not only material agents but also *mechanisms* for reproducing content, amplifying it, tracking attention to it, and generating revenue from it. Content does not need to communicate a message in this model; it simply needs to circulate. Understanding this economy of media, including global media revenue, helps us to better understand the material conditions and labour of communication today, including phenomena like resource extraction, content farms and content moderation, crowdsourcing and distributed workforces, gamblification, and gig work. This week, we'll talk about the culture and content industries, who owns media and media infrastructures, if and when media are regulated, and what it means to produce content in the 2020s. 

*Questions for this week*: When are media a distraction? How is mediation also labour? How do you distinguish between entertainment and news in your everyday life? And what does "content capital" mean to you and your communities? 

*Primary source for the week*: Origame Digital and Naphtali Faulkner's [*Umurangi Generation*](https://www.umurangigeneration.com/) (2020), "a first person photography game in the shitty future. Set in Tauranga Aotearoa off the back of an impending crisis you are a courier for the Tauranga Express." Content warning: catastrophe; themes addressing the structural effects and lived experiences of colonialism, capitalism, fascism, and climate change.

*Format for the week*: simulation (video game made for consoles using Unity)

*Technique for the week*: tracing. Research *Umurangi Generation* to describe&#8212;to the best of your knowledge&#8212;the labour, materials, and institutions involved in making it. Attribute the labour where possible and also note what you can't determine or trace. 

Approaches addressed this week: political economy; neoliberalism; vertical and horizontal integration; labour studies; infrastructure studies; ownership effects (public, private, corporate, and indie); media regulation; the culture industry; the content industry; fandom and participatory culture
