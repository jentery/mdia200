## Week 3 (Sept. 18 and 21): Media and Mass Communication

This week, media are not only material agents but also *channels* for transmitting messages or *vehicles* for encoding and decoding them. Sender-receiver and one-to-many dynamics are common in the organizational and mass communication paradigms. Investments in information, encryption, and matters of scale are common, too. We'll talk about these paradigms in the contexts of mass media, globalization, and media proliferation. 

*Questions for this week*: Do you think messages can be isolated or extracted from media? From their contexts? When and why might you ask, "Can you hear me?" or "Did you get my message?" And when and why might you declare, "There will be no more communication"? 

*Primary source for the week*: [Season 1, Cassette 1](https://beta.prx.org/stories/232303) of Janina Matthewson, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, and Nightvale's [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), which "takes the form of an audio course in full body relaxation issued by The Institute to you, (the listener) a nameless medical inmate. Is the narrator relaying something more than just relaxation techniques? As listeners move through the relaxation curriculum a deeper and more personal story unravels." Content warning: bugs (including bug abuse), gaslighting, stalking, medical setting, and themes related to mental health and pathologization

*Format for the week*: podcast (anthology)

*Technique for the week*: recontextualization. Develop the backstory for Oleta or Hester in *Within the Wires* to further explain why she performs the role of sender or receiver in the story's one-to-one and one-to-many communications. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: the mathematical model of communication (transmission), the social model of communication (encoding-decoding), two-step flow, convergence

## Week 4 (Sept. 25 and 28): Media and Communication as Culture

This week, media are not only material agents but also *practices* that reproduce the communication habits and values of a *community* or *worldview*. Think of cosplay or Reddit communities, for example, alongside phrases like "indie culture," "the culture of Hollywood," "queer culture," and "gamer culture." Culture is, in this sense, a way of living as well as the content or "canon" associated with it. We'll talk about media and power as well as how cultural approaches offer alternatives to "media effects" paradigms and transmission models of communication. 

*Questions for this week*: Why are media so often associated with popular culture? Do you think people tend to passively, actively, or selectively engage media? How are media entwined with how we learn to look, watch, listen, and play? How are the expressions or demonstrations of power and resistance? 

*Primary sources for the week*: 1) Momo Pixel's [*Hair Nah*](https://www.momopixel.com/hair-nah) (2017), "a travel game about a black woman who is tired of people touching her hair." Content warning: "micro-aggression of assumed authority and ownership of black bodies." 2) Adrian Tomine's ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/killing-and-dying/) (2015), "a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images." Content warning: conflict between parents, bad dad, and themes of assimilation and leaving home.

*Format for the week*: comic (in a graphic novel)

*Technique for the week*: annotation. Use the margins and gutters of "Translated, from the Japanese" to describe how it uses symbols and gestures to communicate the realities of Japan, the United States, and travel between them. 

## Weeks 5 and 6 (Oct. 5 and 12): Media and Art

This week, media are not only material agents but also *environments* for intersecting art with technology. Here, art doesn't transcend its media or lay bare their essence. It is not dissolved by the power or allure of technology, either. It instead treats media as *milieus* for social and sensory experiences. Such milieus tend to blur the boundaries between what is and isn't art. We'll compare this perspective with last week's conversation about media and popular culture, including the common distinction between . . . ahem . . . "high" and "low" culture. 

*Questions for these two week*: Do media always "deliver" a message? What are the politics of aesthetics, and the aesthetics of politics in media? Can you recall a moment when you struggled to distinguish between art and technology? Is it a mistake, or a trap, to associate art with novelty? How does art reflect, deflect, or filter reality, and when does it construct one? 

*Primary source for these two weeks*: Amanda Strong, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, and Bracken Hanuse Corlett's [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.spottedfawnproductions.com/biidaaban/) (2018), where "Biidaaban and Sabe fight to continue traditionally collecting maple sap in modern-day suburban 'Ontario.'" Also see Simpson's poem, "Caribou Ghosts and Untold Stories." Content warning: settler colonialism (including physical and psychological violence), surveillance, and some horror motifs (especially in the lighting and music).

*Format for these two weeks*: animation (stop-motion; video on streaming platforms)

*Technique for these two weeks*: masking. Watch the animation as is and then attend only to the video (turn off the sound), only the audio (turn of the screen), and only the text (read Simpson's poetry). Describe the *Biidaaban*'s composition, message(s), and your experience of them as you go. Strong's [description](https://www.spottedfawnproductions.com/biidaaban) of *Biidaaban* is also informative here: “Since time immemorial, Indigenous people have harvested sap from trees to produce syrup, a practice that continues today. Biidaaban, a young Indigenous genderfluid person, and Sabe, a Sasquatch shape-shifter, set out to harvest sap from sugar maples in their urban environment. Biidaabaan can see traces of time, people, creatures and land. By harvesting syrup in this way, they are continuing the work of their ancestors. Ancestors and animals such as Ghost Caribou and Ghost Wolf are embedded within the landscape, but only Biidaaban can see them. These visuals reverberate throughout the work to draw from the past, but what we see is steadfast in the present.” 

*Approaches addressed during these two weeks*: medium specificity, media art, intermedia, transmedia, experimental media, realism, auteur theory, artists direct

*Approaches addressed this week*: media effects (direct, minimal, and third-person); uses and gratification model; social cognitive theory (especially representational modelling); cultivation effects (especially enculturation and mainstreaming); agenda setting; the ritual view of communication; representation (especially absence and stereotypes); institutions and hegemony (including dominant, negotiated, and oppositional readings); the gaze; framing; critical race theory; critical disability theory; queer theory; de-, post-, and anti-colonial theory; intersectional feminism; textual analysis

## Week 7 (Oct. 16 and 19): Media and Affect

This week, media are not only material agents but also *vibes* felt, perhaps unconsciously, during the experience of watching, playing, reading, or the like. Such feelings are deeply corporeal and deeply social, like the shared pulse of horror in the cinema or the collective intensity of a co-op survival game. Media act upon you in these moments, and your body becomes an interface of sorts. We'll try to apply scholarship on affect by, somewhat ironically, talking about and around this week's primary source without watching it (partly because I was unsure whether to assign you the experience). Reaction vids are therefore optional.

*Questions for this week*: How are the corporeal experiences of media entwined with liveness? With nostalgia? With trends and hype cycles? How is affect contagious? How would you describe the relation between affect and your personal sense of agency? 

*Primary source for the week*: Hwang Dong-hyuk's *Squid Game* (2021). But don't watch it (unless you have already). Please read this secondary source instead: Angela Haupt's ["You Don’t Like Violence But Want to Watch *Squid Game.* These Tips Can Help"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/10/14/tv-violence-squid-game-watch/) (2021). 

*Format for the week*: television (serialized into nine episodes; streaming on Netflix)

*Technique for the week*: social tie. Describe an example of when your sensory or visceral experience of a particular work facilitated a bond (be it local or distant) with other people. Please mention the format of the work (game, comic, livestream, animation, short fiction, etc.) whether you ultimately liked or disliked it. Since we're talking about affect, you're welcome to note when or why the experience is difficult to put into words. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: the spectacle (commodity fetishism), remediation, premediation, bandwagon effect, addictive design, flow theory (including immersion), audience studies, political phenomenology (including affect aliens), mimetic communication 

## Week 8 (Oct. 23 and 26): Media and Meaning

This week, media are not only material agents; they either consist of *signs* organized according to codes or become *difference engines* in the play of discourse. A sign may be reductive, or it may invite many possible meanings. Perhaps the messenger is literal, or maybe they're a poet or trickster. Meanings may persist, overlap, or contradict each other, and&#8212;most interesting&#8212;they are frequently unintended. Consider those moments when someone asserts, "I didn't mean to say that!" While noise in the transmission model may lack semantic value, unintended communications can be semantically rich. We'll see what kind of surprises arise in our conversations about media and meaning this week. 

*Questions for this week*: Must we mean what we communicate in writing? In speech? What strikes you as uncertain or unpredictable in the practice of media, and how do you take responsibility for what you didn't intend in your media work? Is it possible to make meaning without a code? 

*Primary source for the week*: Nalo Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle" (PDF; [2004](https://pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=425)), "a radical new twist on the time travel tale that demolishes the sentimental myth of childhood innocence." Content warning: racism; sexism; ableism; settler colonialism; gaslighting; sexual content, including strong language. 

*Format for the week*: short fiction (published in a paperback and e-book collection)

*Technique for the week*: theatre of the imagination. COMPLETE.

*Approaches addressed this week*: semiotics (icon, symbol, and index as well as types of codes); discourse; social order 

## Week 9 (Oct. 30 and Nov. 2): Media and Narrative

This week, media are not only material agents but also *patterns* in how stories and experiences are transformed by narratives. Media play significant roles in the construction of heroes and villains, arcs and perspectives, plots and subplots, quests and conflicts. Today, a common question is whether a narrative is interactive, nonlinear, or branching. Can you choose your own adventure? How many endings are there? The popular perception that digital media are inherently interactive helps to explain these questions, yet so, too, do people's desires for participation in storytelling and even genre. This week, we'll review some narratives and genres we've encountered this term and then shift our attention to how narratives emerge, or are crafted, from everyday activities, particularly the activity of play. 

*Questions for this week*: How do genres shape your expectations of media or your media habits? What's your preferred format for narrative content? When and why do media brush against the desire or impulse for narrative? What's a narrative that surprised you in some way? 

*Primary source for the week*: Niantic's [*Pokémon GO*](https://pokemongolive.com/) (2016), which "uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual creatures, called Pokémon, [who] appear as if they are in the player's real-world location." Content warning: bug-, snake- and spider-like Pokémon.

*Format for the week*: mobile game (augmented reality)

*Technique for the week*: storyboarding. Use text and images to transform the experience of playing *Pokémon GO* into a narrative of your choice. The narrative should consist of at least three scenes. 

*Approaches addressed this week*: environmental storytelling (especially emergent storytelling); narratology (especially narrative transformation); genre studies (especially genre as a social activity); ludology (especially ludonarrative dissonance)

## Week 10 (Nov. 6 and 9): The Economy of Media

This week, media are not only material agents but also *mechanisms* for reproducing content, amplifying it, tracking attention to it, and generating revenue from it. Content does not need to communicate a message in this model; it simply needs to circulate. Understanding this economy of media, including global media revenue, helps us to better understand the material conditions and labour of communication today, including phenomena like resource extraction, content farms and content moderation, crowdsourcing and distributed workforces, gamblification, and gig work. This week, we'll talk about the culture and content industries, who owns media and media infrastructures, if and when media are regulated, and what it means to produce content in the 2020s. 

*Questions for this week*: When are media a distraction? How is mediation also labour? How do you distinguish between entertainment and news in your everyday life? And what does "content capital" mean to you and your communities? 

*Primary source for the week*: Origame Digital and Naphtali Faulkner's [*Umurangi Generation*](https://www.umurangigeneration.com/) (2020), "a first person photography game in the shitty future. Set in Tauranga Aotearoa off the back of an impending crisis you are a courier for the Tauranga Express." Content warning: catastrophe; themes addressing the structural effects and lived experiences of colonialism, capitalism, fascism, and climate change.

*Format for the week*: simulation (video game made for consoles using Unity)

*Technique for the week*: tracing. Research *Umurangi Generation* to describe&#8212;to the best of your knowledge&#8212;the labour, materials, and institutions involved in making it. Attribute the labour where possible and also note what you can't determine or trace. 

Approaches addressed this week: political economy; neoliberalism; vertical and horizontal integration; labour studies; infrastructure studies; ownership effects (public, private, corporate, and indie); media regulation; the culture industry; the content industry; fandom and participatory culture
